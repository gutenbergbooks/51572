<p class="let">It is many years since we first met at the
house of one whom we both loved, whose memory we
both cherish. It was that friend’s hope that you
and I should become, and should remain friends; and
that the hope has been realised has given me many
happy hours&mdash;sometimes in your company as my
gracious hostess, sometimes, scarcely less closely in
your company, as a reader of your delightful and
beautiful stories. Were your gallant General&mdash;I
remember how proud he was of those stories&mdash;alive
to-day, I should have asked to be allowed to dedicate
this book to the two of you. Now that&mdash;alas for the
England that he so faithfully loved, so nobly served&mdash;he
is with us no more, may I inscribe it to yourself
and to his honoured memory?</p>

<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">One</span> of the subjects of these studies said in
my hearing, that “Recollections” are
generally written by people who have
either entirely lost their memory, or have never,
themselves, done anything in life worth remembering.</p>

<p>To the second indictment I plead guilty, but my
best excuse for the publication of this volume is that
I write while the first indictment fails. My memory
is still good, and the one thing which seems most
worth remembering in my life is my undeservedly
fortunate friendships.</p>

<p>In writing of my friends and of those with whom
I was associated, I am, therefore, I believe, giving
of my best. I ought to add that these papers were
penned for inclusion in a volume of frankly personal
and intimate “Recollections.” A work of that sort
is the one book of his life in which an author is
allowed some freedom from convention. That is
why I hope to be pardoned should any passage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
letter, or incident in these pages seem too intimate
or too personal.</p>

<p>The reason why the studies are printed separately
is that the ship in which I hope to carry the
bulk of my threatened “Recollections” (if ever
that ship come to port) will be so heavily weighted
a vessel, that I am lightening it by unloading a
portion of the cargo at the friendly harbour of The
Bodley Head.</p>

<p>To drop figurative language and to speak
plainly, I may add that, though there is some
attempt at a more or less finished portrait in some
of my pen-pictures, that of Lord Roberts is no
portrait, but merely a chronicle. His personality, at
least, is too well known and loved to need either
analysis or description.</p>

<p>The paper <cite>When Stephen Phillips Read</cite>, mere
snapshot as it is of one aspect of his personality,
was not written for the present volume, with which,
indeed, it is hardly in keeping. I include it by the
wish of Mr. John Lane who, years hence, will be
remembered as the faithful friend, as well as the
generous and discriminating admirer, of the distinguished
poet, of whose work it is his pride also
to be the publisher.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane was anxious&mdash;knowing that my friendship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
with the poet was long and close&mdash;that I should write
of Stephen Phillips as fully as I have here written
of some others; but it is only under impulse that
I seek to picture the inner self and personality of
my friends, and I cannot do so while the sense of
loss is comparatively new. In the case of two of
whom I have thus written, many years had elapsed
before I put pen to paper.</p>

<p>At his best&mdash;as the three friends who made
such unexampled and such self-sacrificing efforts
on his behalf, Sir Sidney and Lady Colvin and Mr.
Stephen Gwynn, will, I think, agree&mdash;there was
something approaching the godlike in Stephen
Phillips. Of what was weak, and worse, in him I
need not here speak, since, because he so loathed
hypocrisy, he hid it from none.</p>

<p>One day I hope to show Stephen Phillips as he
really was, and as not many knew him. I have
heard him described as a man of brooding and
morbid aloofness. There is truth in the description,
but it is equally true to say that, at times, he could
be as healthily jovial and unconstrained, as high-spirited
as a happy schoolboy. His exquisite and
extraordinary sense of humour was&mdash;I had almost
written his “salvation,” and that not only under
success which, coming early in life, might well have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">x</a></span>
turned the head of a smaller man, but also in
adversity which, when it came, was as crushing
as his success had been complete. When this adversity,
when tragic unhappiness, overtook him, he
bore them with courage, and reproached no one
except himself.</p>

<p>If as a poet he was at first overpraised, it is
equally true that, towards the end, and since his
death, the splendour, beauty and power of his
poetry have often been underestimated. Time
will set that right, and will rank him, I believe, as
a true and, within his limits, a great poet.</p>

<p>That Stephen Phillips, the man, gave no cause
for sorrow and concern to those of us who loved
him, I do not maintain, nor would he wish me to do
so, for no one was more ready to acknowledge his
weaknesses&mdash;deeply and almost despairingly as
he deplored them&mdash;and none suffered intenser
agony of remorse for ill-doing than he.</p>

<p>Knowing him as I did, I unhesitatingly aver
that his ideals and his longings were noble, and
that the soul of the man was good. That all is well
with him, and that he is at rest, I have no doubt.
Never have I seen such fulness of peace and such
beauty on the face of the newly dead, as when I
knelt&mdash;to commend his passing soul to his Maker&mdash;by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
the bed on which lay what was mortal
of Stephen Phillips. All that was weak and unworthy
seemed to have fallen away as something which
never was, which never could be, a part of his
true self. In death, even his youth returned to
him. As he lay there, white-robed, and with his
hair tossed boyishly over his forehead, he looked
so young that one might have thought him to be a
happy and sleeping boy-chorister, dreaming of the
poet-mother whom he so loved, and to join whom
in Paradise may not his soul even then have been
hastening?</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Swinburne</span> was furious.</p>

<p>I had lunched with him and Watts-Dunton
at The Pines, and after I had smoked
a cigarette with the latter, the author of <cite>Atalanta
in Calydon</cite> had invited me upstairs to his sanctum,
that he might show me the latest acquisition to his
library&mdash;a big parchment-bound book tied with
ribbons&mdash;the Kelmscott reprint of one of Caxton’s
books. He waxed enthusiastic, I remember, over
the Rape of Danae. Then he took up the proofs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
an article on John Day which he was contributing
to the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite> that he might read some
passages from it. To verify a quotation, he walked
to his shelves in search of a book, talking volubly
meanwhile, and turning, as was his custom, to look
directly at the person whom he was addressing.
Unlike Watts-Dunton, whose library was a witness
to the catholicity of the owner’s interests and of his
tastes, Swinburne’s library was comparatively small
and select, for he was as exclusive in regard to the
books he admitted to his shelves as he was in regard
to the men and women he admitted to his friendship.
Knowing exactly, I suppose, where the required
volume was to be found, his hand went as
confidently towards it&mdash;even though his face was
turned away from it, and towards me&mdash;as the fingers
of a musician go towards the keys of a piano at which
he does not look. For once Swinburne’s instincts
played him false. Taking down the book without
glancing at it, and still pouring out a torrent of words,
he opened it, his eyes on my face, and shaking the
forefinger of his right hand at me, said:</p>

<p>“Here it is! Listen!” and dropped his eyes
upon the page.</p>

<p>To my astonishment his face suddenly crimsoned,
the eyes that might once have been bright blue, but
were now faded, and, in fading, seemed to have
caught and retained something of the colour of the
great seas and of the grassy fields upon which they
have so often and so lovingly lingered, glowed with
green fire like that we see in the eyes of an angry
cat, and he flung the book away from him in a
tornado of wrath. He had taken down the wrong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
volume, an anthology, and opened at a page on
which was printed a poem by the particular writer
who, like the wearer of a red coat intruding thoughtlessly
upon the domain of an angry bull, happened
at that particular moment to be the subject of a
poet’s capricious wrath&mdash;for on occasion I have
heard Swinburne speak with kindly, if contemptuous
toleration, of a writer whose damnation in this
world and the next he seemed at another time
ardently to desire.</p>

<p>“Of all my imitators,” he shrilled, literally
quivering with the tempestuousness of his passion,
“this fellow (mentioning a poet whose name I suppress)
is the most intolerable. I claim&mdash;and you,
I know, will admit the justice of the claim&mdash;that
perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of my
work in poetry is that I have taken old and hackneyed
metres, and have tried to transform them
from a mere jingle, and a mere jig-jig, into music.
This pestilent ape has vulgarised what I have done
by servile imitations of my manner and of my
methods; but, what I had transformed into music,
he has transformed back into the vilest and most
jigging of jingles.”</p>

<p>When a poet of Swinburne’s eminence thus turns
the searchlight of criticism upon himself, and
seeks to lay bare, in a few pregnant sentences, what
he considers the secret of his art and of his success,
one must necessarily be interested and even fascinated.
On this occasion, however, I was more
concerned about the singular state of nervous
excitability into which my host had worked himself
than curious to draw him out by further discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Sir James Barrie says somewhere that “Temper is
a weapon which we handle by the blade,” a tragic
instance of the truth of which I had in mind at that
moment. A certain distinguished writer, now dead,
who like Swinburne was a good hater, and scarcely
less excitable than he, had made, or imagined that he
had made (the vagaries of the artistic temperament
are many), a deadly enemy of a fellow craftsman and
critic. Every adverse review of his work, or unfriendly
reference to himself, which appeared in the
public Press, he insisted on attributing, directly or
indirectly, to the malignity of this supposed enemy.
A not ungenerous man at heart, in spite of&mdash;possibly
because of&mdash;his blaze of a temper and quickness to
take offence, the distinguished writer in question
had shown much interest in a struggling young
author of his own nationality, and had not only
assisted him financially, but had been at great pains
to find a publisher for the lad’s first book, and had
importuned his friends on the Press to review the
work favourably and at length. The first notice to
appear was adverse in the extreme, and the distinguished
writer instantly declared that he saw in it
the hand of his enemy, who had sought to stab at
him by damning the work of a young fellow known
to be his friend and protégé.</p>

<p>Flinging the paper containing the review upon the
ground, he stamped upon it, and about the room,
working himself up finally into so furious a passion
that it brought on a seizure from which he never
entirely recovered, and that practically ended his
career.</p>

<p>“Temper is a weapon which we handle by the blade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
This story I had only recently heard, and had
good reason for believing. Seeing my host literally
trembling and quivering in every limb with the
intensity of the excitement, and of the anger into
which he had worked himself, my one anxiety was
to distract the attention of this representative of
the proverbially irritable race of geniuses from the
disturbing subject, and to soothe him back to his
normal calm. Unfortunately for me, his deafness
made my task difficult, but I chanced to hit upon a
topic in which he was keenly interested, and, little
by little, he quieted down, until I could see that he
had talked himself out and was ready for the afternoon
nap in which it was his custom to indulge.</p>

<p>Remembering that incident, and others like it
within my knowledge, I ask myself how it is possible
to judge men and women of genius&mdash;men and women
to whose great brains the live blood rushes at a
thought or at a word; whose passions are like a laid
fuse, ready to take fire and to explode the mine at
a touch&mdash;by the same standard which we apply to
the cold-blooded, sluggish-brained, lethargic and
perhaps more fortunate mortals to whom impulse
is unknown, upon whom passion has no sway, and
who rarely commit themselves to any expression or
to any action, noble or mean, wise or indiscreet,
without first of all carefully weighing the results
and counting up the costs.</p>

<p>“It is apparently too often a congenial task,”
says George Eliot in her <cite>Essay on Heine</cite>, “to write
severe words about the transgressions of men of
genius; especially when the censor has the advantage
of being himself a man of no genius, so that those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
transgressions seem to him quite gratuitous; he,
forsooth, never lacerated anyone by his wit or gave
irresistible piquancy to a coarse allusion; and his
indignation is not mitigated by any knowledge of
the temptation that lies in transcendent power.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Of all controversialists (and he dearly loved a
verbal encounter) to whom I have ever listened,
Swinburne was incomparably the most crushing.
He fought with scrupulous and knightly fairness,
never stooping to take a mean advantage of an
adversary, and listening patiently, punctiliously
even, while the other side was making its points.
But, when his turn came, he carried everything before
him. Vesuvius in eruption could not more
effectually overwhelm or consume the rubble around
its crater than Swinburne could scarify or sweep
away, by a lava-torrent of burning words, the most
weighty arguments of his opponents.</p>

<p>So, too, with his conversation. When he was
moved by his subject, when he talked in dead
earnest, he did nothing else. He forgot everything.
In the middle, or even at the beginning of a meal, he
would lay down knife and fork, and turn to face his
listener, quite oblivious of, or indifferent to the fact
that his dinner or lunch was spoiling.</p>

<p>On one occasion I happened, half-way through
lunch, to mention that I had in my pocket a copy
of Christina Rossetti’s latest poem, written in
memory of the Duke of Clarence, and entitled
<cite>The Death of a First-born</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Down went knife and fork as he half rose from
his chair to stretch a hand across the table for the
manuscript.</p>

<p>“She is as a god to mortals when compared to
most other living women poets,” he exclaimed in
a burst of Swinburnian hyperbole.</p>

<p>Then in his thin, high-pitched but exquisitely
modulated and musical voice he half read, half
chanted two verses of the poem in question:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One young life lost, two happy young lives blighted<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With earthward eyes we see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes uplifted, keener, farther-sighted<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We look, O Lord, to Thee.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grief hears a funeral knell: Hope hears the ringing<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of birthday bells on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faith, Hope and Love make answer with soft singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Half carol and half cry.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Then he stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“I won’t read the third and last verse,” he said.
“One glance at it is sufficient to show that it is unequal,
and that the poem would be stronger and
finer by its omission. But for the happy folk who
are able to think as she thinks, who believe as she
believes on religious matters, the poem is of its kind
perfect. Let me read that second verse again,” and
with glowing eyes, with hand marking time to the
music, he read once more:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grief hears a funeral knell: Hope hears the ringing<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of birthday bells on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faith, Hope and Love make answer with soft singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Half carol and half cry.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The last line, “Half carol and half cry,” he
repeated three times, lowering his voice with each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
repetition, until at last it was little more than a
whisper, and so died away, like the undistinguishable
ceasing of far-off music.</p>

<p>Laying the manuscript reverently beside him, he
sat perfectly still for a space and with brooding
beautiful eyes. Then rising without a word he stole
silently, softly, almost ghost-like, but with short,
swift steps out of the room.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Though it was my privilege to count among my
friends several personal friends of Swinburne&mdash;notably
the late Theodore Watts-Dunton, Philip
Bourke Marston, and the dearest and closest of
all my friends, Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton&mdash;it
was not until the first weeks of 1892 that I met
him personally.</p>

<p>I was invited to lunch at The Pines, and the first
thing that struck me as I entered the dining-room
and took the extended hand, which was soft and
limp, and had no sturdiness in the grasp, was the
singular charm and even courtliness of his bearing.
Unmistakably an aristocrat, and with all the ease
and polish which one associates with high breeding,
there was, even in the cordiality with which he rose
and came forward to welcome me, a suspicion of the
shy nervousness of the introspective man and of the
recluse on first facing a stranger. It had passed in
a few minutes, and I saw no trace of it at any of our
subsequent meetings, but to the last his courtliness
remained. I have seen him angry, I have heard him
furiously dissent from and even denounce the views<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
put forward by others, but never once was what, for
want of a better word, I must call his personal
deference to those others relaxed. With him the
proverbial familiarity which is said to breed contempt,
bred only more consistent and insistent
courtesy. To no one would he defer quite so graciously
and readily, to no one was he so scrupulously
courtly in his bearing, as to those who constituted
the household in which he lived. On the occasion
of this first meeting with him he talked with extraordinary
animation, sitting up erectly in his chair
and moving his body or limbs stiffly and jerkily.
He had not long returned from his forenoon walk,
and, if I may be pardoned so far-fetched a comparison,
he was like a newly-opened bottle of
champagne, bubbling and brimming over with the
buoyant, beady, joyous and joy-giving wine of
morning. Watts-Dunton, always generously ready
to interest himself, and to endeavour to interest
others, in the work of a young writer of ability, was
anxious to talk about my friend, Richard Le
Gallienne. He might as well, by making a stopper
of his open hand, have tried permanently to prevent
the overflow of the champagne bottle which I have
used for the purpose of a fanciful comparison. The
moment he withdrew his hand, the instant he ceased
to speak of Le Gallienne, Swinburne, as represented
by the newly-opened bottle, was bubbling over
again about his walk. The wine of it was in his
veins and seemed to have intoxicated him.</p>

<p>“There is no time like the morning for a walk!”
he declared, turning to me with enthusiasm. “The
sparkle, the exhilaration of it! I walk every morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of my life, no matter what the weather, pelting
along all the time as fast as I can go; and it is
entirely to my daily walk that I attribute my perfect
health.”</p>

<p>On hearing that I, too, was a great, as well as a
fast walker, Swinburne looked me up and down
challengingly, and said with a smile that was almost
like a merry boy’s:</p>

<p>“Yes! but I think I could outwalk you, and get
there first, for all your six feet!” Then, turning to
Watts-Dunton, he apologised playfully for having
monopolised the talk, and said, “Now tell me
about your young poet. His is certainly the most
beautiful poet-face since Shelley’s.”</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton replied by reading some extracts
from a “Note on Swinburne” which Le Gallienne had
contributed to <cite>Literary Opinion</cite>, Swinburne listening
with downbent head meanwhile. When Watts-Dunton
had made an end of it, and Swinburne had
expressed his appreciation, the latter inquired how
I first came to know Le Gallienne, and learning that
when I was acting as the Editor of the English
edition of <cite>Lippincott’s Magazine</cite> I had, in that
capacity or incapacity, accepted one of Le Gallienne’s
first published articles, <cite>The Nature Poems
of George Meredith</cite>, he asked if I knew Sir J.&nbsp;M.
Barrie, who he considered had been much influenced
by the author of <cite>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</cite>.</p>

<p>“Only slightly,” I answered. “I suggested, in
fact organised a dinner to dear old F.&nbsp;W. Robinson,
in whose magazine <cite>Home Chimes</cite> much of the
early work of Barrie, Jerome K. Jerome, Zangwill,
Eden Phillpotts, G.&nbsp;B. Burgin, and many others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
who have since come into their own, appeared.
Jerome took the chair and Barrie the vice-chair,
and the dinner was something of a record in the
list of distinguished men present, and was, I believe,
one of the few functions of the sort of which an
account appeared in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>. It was there
I first met Barrie.”</p>

<p>“Robinson of <cite>Grandmother’s Money</cite>,” cried
Swinburne in an ecstasy of enthusiasm. “You have
mentioned the name of one of the very salt of the
earth, and one of the dearest friends of both of
us here. We contributed to the first number
of <cite>Home Chimes</cite>. Watts-Dunton wrote a noble
Sonnet of Greeting, and I printed my Sonnet <cite>Near
Cromer</cite> there. His novels, I grant, though
eminently readable, as the reviewers say, are not
great. Unlike Dr. Gilbert’s, they do not dovetail.
Finishing one chapter, you are not restless and
uneasy till you have read the next, and that is a
fatal defect in a novelist.”</p>

<p>Speaking of Robinson and <cite>Home Chimes</cite> reminded
Swinburne of the fact that it was in that unfortunately
named and defunct magazine that he had seen
some of the best work of Philip Bourke Marston,
the blind poet, concerning whom I had contributed
an article to the current number of the <cite>Fortnightly
Review</cite>. This article Swinburne had read and wished
to discuss, for, whereas my friendship with Philip
Marston was not of long standing, he had known
the blind poet since the latter was a lad of fourteen,
and on the day after Philip’s death had written a
memorial sonnet which was subsequently printed
in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Swinburne’s remarks upon the subject of my
article&mdash;though I need hardly say I have forgotten
no word of what he said&mdash;I pass over, but what I
must not pass over is the witness these remarks
bore to his extraordinary memory and to his equally
extraordinary method of reading. Reading, in
fact, is not the word. Had he parsed the article,
schoolboy wise, sentence by sentence, he could
not more effectually have mastered it; had he
dissected it, part by part, surgeon-like, he could
not more completely have torn the heart out of
the matter.</p>

<p>Obviously Swinburne could only have read the
thing once, yet had I, the writer, been called upon,
even while it was fresh in my memory, to pass an
examination on this very article, I doubt whether
I should have known half as much of it as he. Hearing
him thus deliver himself upon a casual contribution
to a periodical, which, by reason of his
love and friendship for the blind poet with whom
the article dealt, had chanced to interest him, I
could understand how his single brain had been
able to deal illuminatingly with so vast a volume
of literature as he had from time to time passed under
review. His power of concentration, and of pouncing,
hawk-like, upon what seemed to him to be
memorable or salient, as well as his ability to
recollect all he had read, must have been extraordinary.</p>

<p>A more exhaustive summing up&mdash;not, I admit,
of the evidence on both sides, but of the evidence
which appealed to his individual judgment, his
individual imagination, and his individual taste&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
have never heard. Prejudiced as he was, however, in
favour of Marston, he would not go so far as Rossetti,
for his last word on the subject was:</p>

<p>“When Gabriel spoke of Philip’s poem, <cite>The Rose
and the Wind</cite>, as ‘worthy of Shakespeare in his
subtlest lyrical mood,’ he let his personal affection
run away with his critical judgment, and his verdict
must always be discounted by the fact that Philip
was the aptest pupil in the School of Poetry in
which Rossetti was the acknowledged master.
Watts-Dunton is a much surer guide, and when he
said that ‘So perfect a lyric as <cite>The Rose and the
Wind</cite> should entitle Marston to a place of his own,
and that no inconsiderable one,’ he said the true
word, the deserved word, and the word which I do
not think anyone will have the hardihood to
dispute.”</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>When next I met Swinburne, nearly twelve months
had gone by, and, in spite of the eager way in which
at our first meeting he had talked of the men and
women and things within his own mental horizon,
I should not have been in the least surprised to
find that he had practically forgotten me. I do not
say this in any spirit of mock modesty, but because
I remembered that, at that first meeting, I had
mentioned, in the course of conversation, a book
by a certain author who to my knowledge had been
a visitor to The Pines on several occasions, and so
must personally have been well known to Swinburne.</p>

<p>“Oh, really!” he said. “Yes, now that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
mention it, I believe that someone of that name
has been so good as to come and see us. I seem to
recall him. And I seem to remember hearing someone
say that he had written something, though I
don’t remember exactly what. So he has published
a book upon the subject of which we are talking.
Really? I did not know.”</p>

<p>This was said with perfect courtesy, and without
the remotest intention of administering a snub
either to me or to the literary reputation of the
writer in question. It meant no more than that
Swinburne lived so apart from the rest of the world,
had such power of detachment, and kept so habitually
the company only of his books and of his
peers, that the personality of the rest of us left no
impression on him.</p>

<p>On this occasion, only Watts-Dunton, Miss Teresa
Watts, his sister, Swinburne, and myself were
present, and the talk turned at first upon
William Rossetti, with whom, in his home at St.
Edmund’s Terrace, Regent’s Park, I had spent an
hour or two on the previous afternoon. Both
Swinburne and Watts-Dunton were interested to
hear news of their old friend whom both regretted
seeing so seldom. They plied me with innumerable
questions in regard to his health, his plans,
even in regard to trivial details about his home
life, not omitting mention of his sister Christina’s
beloved cat “Muff,” and the red plush sofa on
which Shelley was supposed to have slept, the
night before his death, and that now stands in the
library. Both my hearers were touched when I
spoke of Rossetti’s affectionate words about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
William Morris, for whom, though “Topsy” (as
he called Morris) and he had not met five times in
twenty years, Rossetti to the last entertained
the old affection. Rossetti’s vivid recollection
of the day of the funeral of Watts-Dunton’s
mother, some fifteen years before, when there
was so terrible a blizzard that he could get no
conveyance to Endsleigh Gardens&mdash;where he was
then living&mdash;and had to fight his way home on foot
in a blinding snowstorm, was naturally of special
interest to Watts-Dunton. Much more was
said, and many other questions were asked, upon
which I do not propose here to linger, passing on,
instead, to speak of the sudden flaming up of
Swinburne at the mention by Rossetti of William
Bell Scott as having once been a drawing master.</p>

<p>“Perfectly true! Perfectly true!” interpolated
Swinburne angrily, “and a drawing master he
remained to his life’s end.”</p>

<p>For the remainder of my stay he talked vivaciously,
and here I should like to say that in all
that has been written about his personality&mdash;his
eccentricities, excitability and exclusiveness; his
passionate love of the sea and of little children;
the changes that his political views underwent; his
chivalrous championship of his friends against all
comers, and the savage onslaught upon Robert
Buchanan; his sturdy patriotism, and his historic
friendships&mdash;very little has been said of the lighter
side of his nature. That he could wield in controversy
the lash of satire and irony, and wield it
mercilessly, more than one combatant has had
cause to know, and there are alive to-day ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
enemies of his whose backs must still tingle at
memory of some of his onslaughts. But of his wit
and humour in daily life and the sunny playfulness
of his banter in conversation with his friends, one
seldom hears. I have known him keep the table alive
for an hour at a time by whimsical and deliciously
humorous and caustic comments on the topics&mdash;political,
literary, or artistic&mdash;of the day.</p>

<p>On this particular morning he was anxious to
show me a review of <cite>Kriegspiel</cite>, that most remarkable
novel by the late Francis Hinde Groome, son
of the famous archdeacon, the intimate of Edward
FitzGerald, with whom Frank Groome had himself
been well acquainted as a boy.</p>

<p>With Groome&mdash;who, as my readers know, was,
like Watts-Dunton and the late Charles Godfrey
Leland, an accomplished student of Gipsy Life,
Gipsy Language, and Gipsy Lore&mdash;I was myself on
terms of friendship, and indeed had been of some
small service to him in regard to the publication of
<cite>Kriegspiel</cite>, knowing which, Swinburne was anxious
to hear whether I thought the review could be used
to assist the sale of the book, and so elected to go
upstairs to his room to get it.</p>

<p>He returned with a face like that of a schoolboy
intent upon mischief, and with a rolled up journal
in his hand. After I had read the review of <cite>Kriegspiel</cite>,
and proposed sending it on to the publisher,
Watts-Dunton inquired, pointing to the roll which
Swinburne was still holding:</p>

<p>“What have you got there?”</p>

<p>“To-day’s <cite>Graphic</cite>,” was the reply. “I noticed
it sticking out of the pocket of your greatcoat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
hanging in the hall, and peeping inside saw that
there was an illustrated supplement, <cite>Poets of the
Day</cite>, so I wouldn’t even look to see whether you
and I are included, but brought it here that we
might all go through it together. What heart-burning
and hair-tearing there will be in the poetical
dovecotes, in regard to who is in, and who is out!
Why didn’t you tell me of it before?”</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t know anything about it,”
was the reply. “It was from Kernahan’s coat, not
mine, that you took it. We all pick each other’s
brains in Grub Street, but picking pockets is quite
another matter.”</p>

<p>Swinburne apologised, but held on to the <cite>Graphic</cite>
tenaciously. Then he opened it, smoothed out the
page, and ran through the pictured poets, cataloguing
them, complimenting them or chaffing them
upon their appearance or their poetry, even improvising
suitable epitaphs for their obsequies in
Westminster Abbey, or composing, on the spur
of the moment, Nonsense Verses and Limericks that
hit off with delicious humour or mordant irony the
personal or poetical peculiarities of the different
“bards,” as he called them.</p>

<p>Now that he, and so many of these “bards”
are, alas, gone, I hesitate to repeat in cold blood,
and so long after, what was said on the spur of the
moment, and among friends. But, tantalising as it
may be to the reader, especially if that reader be a
poet, and so possibly an interested party, to be told
merely of witty sayings of which no specimen is
forthcoming, I must hold my hand, as I have been
compelled to hold it in other pages of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Recollections. We have it on the authority of Mr.
Clement Shorter that one must be indiscreet to be
entertaining, and I agree with him so far as to
admit that, in Recollections, the best must always
be that which remains unwritten.</p>

<p>After Swinburne had exhausted the <cite>Graphic</cite>, I
produced, from the pocket of the pirated greatcoat,
yet another journal, to which a certain critic had
contributed a somewhat feeble article upon the
work and poetry of Swinburne himself. I read it
aloud, to the accompaniment of ironic laughter on
the part of Watts-Dunton, Miss Watts and myself,
but Swinburne, though he had hugely enjoyed it,
and had interpolated sly comments of exaggerated
gratitude, said, when I had made an end and with
a wave of dismissal:</p>

<p>“It is meant kindly, and when the intention is
so obviously kind one must not be too ungenerously
critical.”</p>

<p>Thereafter we talked of Ireland, Swinburne having
only recently learned or recently realised that I
hailed from that land of poets turned politicians.
I suspect that the fact of my nationality was
responsible for much of his kindness to me, for,
laugh at us as many Englishmen may and do,
in their hearts they have a sneaking liking for
men and women of Irish birth. I had said that I
should be leaving soon after lunch, and after he had
bidden me good-bye, and had retired for his afternoon
sleep, he returned, not once, but two or three
times, and with an impulsiveness which was almost
Irish, to speak again and yet again of Ireland and
especially of Irish poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
It had been my good fortune the night before to
take in Mrs. Lynn Linton to dinner at the beautiful
and hospitable home of Sir Bruce and Lady Seton at
Chelsea, and Mrs. Lynn Linton and I had talked
much of Ireland. Mentioning this to Swinburne, he
said that he had once written to Mrs. Lynn Linton
remonstrating violently with her about an article
of hers on Ireland, and he had reason to believe
that his words had not been without effect, as,
since then, Mrs. Lynn Linton had come to think
as he had on that question, and was of opinion that
Gladstone, Morley and Harcourt ought to have
been impeached for high treason. Reverting to
books, he said that nothing so beautiful about Ireland
had been written as the Hon. Emily Lawless’s
novel <cite>Grania</cite>, then fresh from the press. He had
bought a number of copies to send to his own friends,
as well as some to send to his aunt, Lady Mary
Gordon, for distribution in her circle. He went on to
say that his old friend, Dr. Whitley Stokes, had
shown him some of the Irish songs which were
sung to the tunes to which Tom Moore afterwards
wrote his “mawkish and sentimental songs.” One
of these, Swinburne said, had since been reprinted
in the <cite>Academy</cite>.</p>

<p>“And as poetry I can only compare it to the Book
of Job&mdash;and what more superlatively splendid praise
can I offer than that?”</p>

<p>Here Watts-Dunton put in a word for Wales and
incidentally for Scotland, which reminds me that
I ought to say that Watts-Dunton’s share in this, and
in other conversations, was no less interesting, though
less erratic and more considered than Swinburne’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Switched off thus from Ireland to Scotland,
Swinburne launched out into enthusiastic praise
of the islands of Rum and Eig, the nomenclature of
which, he said, was phonetically and fatally suggestive
of a nourishing, if nauseous drink, not to be
despised, he understood, after an early morning
swim, and declared that the one thing which made
him regret he was not a man of wealth was that
he could not afford to yield to the desire of his heart,
and spend half his time cruising in a yacht around
the western islands of Scotland.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most treasured possession on my bookshelves
is a volume in which Swinburne has inscribed
my name and his own. The volume in question is
his <cite>Studies in Prose and Poetry</cite>, and as, among
the contents, there is an article devoted entirely
to a consideration of the merits and defects of
<cite>Lyra Elegantiarum</cite>, in the editorial work of the
last edition of which it was my honour and privilege
to collaborate with the original compiler, the
late Mr. Frederick Locker-Lampson, I may perhaps
be pardoned for referring to it here.</p>

<p>The fact that Swinburne was making <cite>Lyra
Elegantiarum</cite> the subject of an important article
(it appeared first in the <cite>Forum</cite>) was told to me when
I was lunching one day at The Pines, and naturally
I carried the news of the compliment which his book
was to receive to Mr. Locker-Lampson.</p>

<p>“Compliment!” he exclaimed. “Yes, it will
be a compliment. Any editors might well be proud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
that the result of their labours should be the subject
of an article by Swinburne. But pray heaven
he be merciful, for I fear our expected compliment
is like to turn out to be something of a castigation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Locker-Lampson was not far wrong, for,
when the article appeared, we found that Swinburne
had as roundly rated the editors as he had generously
praised.</p>

<p>I sent Swinburne a copy of the édition de luxe,
a gift with which he was delighted, and indeed procured
other copies to give to friends and relations,
one in a binding of his own designing being, I think,
for his mother. When next I was at The Pines, he
inquired whether Mr. Locker-Lampson and I were
pleased with his review.</p>

<p>“How could we be otherwise than pleased by any
article upon the book by the author of <cite>Atalanta in
Calydon</cite>?” I replied.</p>

<p>“But you were pleased with what I said?”</p>

<p>“Of course, but you must forgive me if I say that
it was very much as if a schoolmaster had called up
a boy out of the class, and, after lavishing undeserved
praise upon him for good behaviour, had
then taken him across his knee and thrashed him
soundly for abominably bad conduct.”</p>

<p>He dived among the litter of papers, reviews,
letters and manuscripts upon the floor, for a copy
of his article, and then read aloud:</p>

<p>“‘There is no better or completer anthology in the
language. I doubt indeed if there be any so good
or so complete. No objection or suggestion that can
reasonably be offered, can in any way diminish our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
obligation, either to the original editor, or to his
evidently able assistant Mr. Kernahan.’</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that please you?” he enquired.</p>

<p>“Immeasurably,” I said.</p>

<p>“And there is more of it,” he went on, reading
detached passages aloud. “‘The editors to their
lasting honour ... the instinctive good sense, the
manly and natural delicacy of the present editors
... this radiant and harmonious gallery of song.’
And so on and so on.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “it is the so ons that I’m thinking
of. Suppose we dip into them.” Then I took the
article from his hand and read as follows: “‘If
elegance is the aim or the condition of this anthology,
how comes it to admit such an unsurpassably
horrible example as the line&mdash;I refrain from quoting
it&mdash;which refers to the “settling” of “Gibson’s
hash”?... The worst positive blemish&mdash;and a most
fearful blemish it is ... will unluckily be found, and
cannot be overlooked, on the fourth page. Sixth
on the list of selected poems, is a copy of verses
attributed to Shakespeare&mdash;of all men on earth!&mdash;by
the infamous pirate, liar, and thief, who published
a worthless little volume of stolen and mutilated
poetry, patched up and padded out with
dreary and dirty doggrel, under the preposterous
title of <cite>The Passionate Pilgrim</cite>.... Happily there is
here no second instance&mdash;but naturally there could
not have been a second&mdash;of such amazing depravity
of taste.’</p>

<p>“In fact,” I said, “your review of the book recalls
to my mind the familiar lines by Bickerstaff,
which are to be found in this very volume:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When late I attempted your pity to move<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What made you so deaf to my prayers?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But why did you kick me downstairs?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">You remember Jeffery Prowse’s lines about someone
being ‘problematically sober, but indubitably
drunk’?” I went on. “The ‘dissembling’ of
‘your love’ in the opening sentences of your article
may be ‘problematical,’ but the ‘kicking’ of us
‘downstairs,’ and out of the door later on, is as
‘indubitable’ as is the fact that the book is profoundly
honoured by being reviewed by Algernon
Charles Swinburne at all.”</p>

<p>With that parting shot, at which he laughed
heartily, I bade him good-bye and came away, to
find on returning to my home, a letter from Mr.
Locker-Lampson which, as it has no word that can
be considered private, and deals with matters of
general literary interest, as well as with some of the
strictures by Swinburne that have been quoted
above, I venture to append:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Newhaven Court, Cromer</span>,<br />
<span class="l2"><i>17th Oct.</i></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I have just been reading the <cite>Forum</cite> for
October, and I think that altogether we may be
satisfied with A.&nbsp;C. S.’s article.</p>

<p>I venture to think that he rather overrates
Landor and underrates Calverley.</p>

<p>We should not have inserted ‘Youth and Art’
[the lines by Browning referring to ‘Gibson’s hash’
to which Mr. Swinburne took such objection] or
‘The Passionate Pilgrim’ or Croker’s ‘Miss Peel.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
We ought to have put in Pope’s ‘I know a
thing.’</p>

<p>I remember talking to Tennyson about Dirce, and
he said it was too classical for English taste. I do
not think many people would care for it, but perhaps
it might be added. Stygean <em>Set</em> is not a cultivated
expression, not better than <em>lot</em>, and if Dirce
was a shade it did not matter whether Charon forgot
himself or not.</p>

<p>I really feel much obliged to Mr. Swinburne for
whom I have sincere regard. Perhaps if you see
him you will tell him of my obligation.</p>

<p>His article strengthens my decided opinion that
the book is a <em>very</em> difficult one to edit. All the experts
have different ideas about it. Lang, Swinburne,
Gosse, Dobson, and Palgrave are all opposed.</p>

<p>I hope you are quite well.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Always truly,</span><br />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In all my conversations with Swinburne, I cannot
recall one instance of his interrupting a speaker.
He would, it is true, go off at a conversational tangent,
as when, talking of Francis Hinde Groome
and Suffolk, he interpolated apparently irrelevant
remarks upon the curious names of some Yorkshire
villages, having presumably only discovered that
morning that one of these villages bore the delightful
name of “Beggar my Neighbour.” But, though
one could see by his flashing eye that the hounds
of utterance were chafing and fretting to fling themselves
upon the quarry, he invariably waited till the
other speaker had made an end of it before letting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
go the leash. To everything that Watts-Dunton
said, then or at any time, he listened almost as a
disciple might listen to a master, and again and
again he urged me to use any influence I had with
the author of <cite>Aylwin</cite> to induce him to give that then
unpublished work to the world, and to allow his
<cite>Athenæum</cite> essays to be collected and issued in book
form.</p>

<p>“Only,” said Swinburne at a white heat of
enthusiastic admiration, “if every page, on which
they were printed, represented a hundred pound
bank-note; if the back and the sides of the cover
were of the finest beaten gold&mdash;that would not be
too costly a raiment for the noblest critical work,
dealing with first principles, that has ever been given
to the world.”</p>

<p>That this was Swinburne’s deliberate opinion of
the value of his brother poet’s and brother friend’s
work, and was not the expression of a moment’s
enthusiasm, I have reason to know, for he used
similar expressions in my presence on many occasions.
I observe, too, that Mr. James Douglas, in
his book <cite>Theodore Watts-Dunton, Poet, Novelist, and
Critic</cite>, quotes Swinburne as describing Watts-Dunton
as “the first critic of his time, perhaps the
largest minded and surest sighted of any age”&mdash;a
judgment which, as Mr. Douglas reminds us, Rossetti
endorsed.</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton, rumpling up his hair with one
hand, tried to turn the conversation into other
channels, but Swinburne was obdurate.</p>

<p>“You, who know Walter’s magnificent, magician-like
power of concentrating into the fourteen lines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of a sonnet what no other poet could have said with
equal power and felicity in forty, will agree with me
when I tell you what perhaps you do not know, for
he never speaks of it himself. When he was a young
man, he lost a manuscript book of poems of which
he had no copy. By these lost poems the world
is, I believe, as poor as if Gabriel Rossetti’s early
poems had never been recovered from his wife’s
coffin. It was an incomparable loss to literature, a
loss which can never be replaced.”</p>

<p>I did not know of these lost poems, for, intimate
as I had been with Watts-Dunton for many years,
he had never even hinted at their existence, or rather
at their non-existence. But, except to admit the
loss and to make light of it, he refused to be drawn
either by Swinburne or by myself, and turned the
conversation upon the former’s <cite>Ode to Music</cite>,
written, I think, for the opening of the Chicago
Exhibition. But of this Swinburne, in his turn, refused
to talk, averring that he had clean forgotten it&mdash;that
a task like that, once completed, he never
thought of again, and that his mind was full at the
moment of his Tennyson Threnody.</p>

<p>On this occasion I saw yet another side of him. I
had brought with me two bunches of exquisite
flowers&mdash;arum lilies, lilies of the valley, snowdrops
and some exotics&mdash;one for Miss Teresa Watts, one
for Swinburne. A flower was to him as it had been
to Philip Marston, the one unchanging and perfect
thing in a changing and decaying world, as fair,
as fresh and as immortal as in the days of our
youth. In an ecstasy of delight, he took the flowers
from my outstretched hand as reverently as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
communicant takes into his hands the consecrated
bread of the sacrament, as tenderly as a young
mother takes into her arms her new-born child. He
bent his head over them in a rapture that was
almost like a prayer, his eyes when he looked up to
thank me for the gift alight and brimming over
with thoughts that were not far from tears. For
many minutes he sat holding them, turning them
this way and that, too rapt in his worship to speak
or to think of anything else.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Miss Watts with his courtly
bow.</p>

<p>“As you have been as equally honoured as
I, you will not think me robbing you if I carry my
bunch away with me to put them in water and to
place them in my own room. I want to find them
there when I wake in the morning.”</p>

<p>He rose in his quiet way, the flowers in his hand,
bowed again to Miss Watts and myself and left the
room. In a few minutes the door reopened, but
only wide enough to let him slip through, and he
stole, rather than walked, to the chair, where he
seated himself among us again, almost as noiselessly
as a card is shuffled back to its place in the
pack.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>“Watts-Dunton writes poetry because he loves
writing it,” said Swinburne to me once. “I write
poetry, I suppose, to escape from boredom.”</p>

<p>There is truth in the statement, but there is more
behind the statement than appears at the first
glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
New and incoming tides of poetry lapped at his
feet each morning, and the incoming of each new
tide of poetry was to him as fresh, pure, crystalline-sweet,
and free, as is the tide that rolls in upon the
shore each day from the vastnesses and the sweetnesses
of the central sea.</p>

<p>Hence he gave himself up to it, plunged in it,
sported in it, with the zeal and rapture of a boy.
Had the call to think poetry, dream poetry, write
poetry, plunge himself into poetry, come to him as
part of a set task, had he been compelled, in the
mood or out of the mood, to take up poetry as an
occupation, he would have turned from it as the
sea-loving swimmer turns from a stagnant pool. It
would have been to him the “boredom” of which
he had spoken, not the “escape from boredom.”</p>

<p>I have said that the impression I formed of him
after my first visit was that of a man who lived in a
world of his own&mdash;a world which, so far as his body
was concerned, was, with the exception of his experiences
on and by the sea, bounded, for the greater
part of his later life, by the four walls of his home,
and by the limits of his daily walk, but which, in
the imaginative and mental sense, was illimitable.
Human and normal in passion, and in every other
respect, as I believe him to have been (so far, that
is to say, as genius, which by overbalancing one
side of a man’s nature, inevitably necessitates some
underbalancing on the other, ever <em>can</em> be said to be
normal), he had seemed to me, on the occasion of
that first visit, a creature of other flesh and blood
than ours, an elusive ethereal poetic essence, rather
than a man of like passions to our own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
It had seemed to me as if the busy world, in which
other men made love and married, begot children,
bought and sold, laboured and schemed&mdash;though
it lay outside his very door&mdash;was a million miles
away from the monastic quiet of the book-lined
room in which he lived and dreamed and wrote.</p>

<p>I do not say that it was so. All I say is that it had
seemed so to me on that first meeting, but I am not
sure that the impression I then formed was accurate.</p>

<p>I came away feeling as if I had been in the company
of a creature living in an unreal world, whereas
now I think that, to the man whom I had left
behind in that book-lined room, life was infinitely
more real than it is to us. I had left behind me,
given over to ecstatic abandonment to the mood of
the moment, and believing intensely in the reality
and actuality of all which that mood called forth, or
created, <em>a child at play with his toys</em>, for in spite of
the magnificence and the maturity of his intellect
(may I not say <em>because</em> of the magnificence and the
maturity of his intellect?) the child lived on and was
alive to the last in Algernon Charles Swinburne as
it lives in few others.</p>

<p>What he had meant when he spoke of writing
poetry “to escape from boredom” was that he was
a tired child turning for comfort, self-forgetfulness
and consolation to his toys; and to him (happy
man!) even his life-work, even Poetry itself, was, in
a sense, a toy. That was why to the last he turned
to it&mdash;an old man in years, though I could never
bring myself to think of him as old&mdash;with such
eager and childlike anticipation. The child heart,
which could exult and build up dreams around his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
toys, remained; but his toys were changed&mdash;that
was all. That was why he so loved and was so loved
by children. They recognised him, bearded man as
he was, as one of themselves. That was why he was
so instantly at home with them, and they with him.
That, too, was why he so revelled in Mr. Kenneth
Grahame’s <cite>The Golden Age</cite>&mdash;not with the mild
reminiscent and ruminant interest and pleasure of
a staid grown-up, chewing the cud of childhood, but
with a boy of ten’s actual and intense identification
with, and abandonment of himself to the part he
was acting, and with all a boy of ten’s natural and
innate love of fun and of mischief. I have seen him
literally dance and caper and whistle (yes, whistle)
with all an eager boy’s rapture, over some new toy
treasure-trove, in the shape of a poem, by himself
or by a friend, a “find” in the shape of a picture,
a print, or a coveted first edition, picked up, during
his rambles, at a stall.</p>

<p>“Eccentricity of genius,” you say?</p>

<p>Not at all. It meant merely that <em>his boyhood was
as immortal as his genius, as ineradicable as his intellectual
greatness</em>.</p>

<p>Warm as was my regard for Algernon Charles
Swinburne the man, profound as is my admiration
of him as a poet, I am not sure that to this child-side
of him must not be attributed much that was noblest
and most lovable in his noble and lovable personality,
as well as much that was loftiest and most
enduring in his work.</p>

<p>Of him we must say, as Mr. William Watson has
so finely said of Tennyson, that he</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is heard for ever, and is seen no more;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
but in seeking, for the purpose of these Recollections,
to conjure the living man before me, in
striving to recall my conversations with him, and
in remembering, as I always do and shall remember,
his great-heartedness, I am reminded of what Watts-Dunton
once said to me in a letter.</p>

<p>“You will recall,” he wrote, “what Swinburne
was remarking to you the other day, when we were
discussing the envy, hatred and malice of a certain
but very small section of the literary craft.
‘Yes,’ said Swinburne, ‘but these are the intellectually-little
writing fellows who do not matter
and who do not count. The biggest men, intellectually,
are always the biggest-natured. Great
hearts go generally with great brains.’”</p>

<p>And I think&mdash;I am sure&mdash;that the saying is true.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was a score or more years ago, and at the
Old Vagabond Club (now merged into the
Playgoers) that I first met Lord Roberts.
When he became the President of the Club, we
celebrated the event by a dinner at which he was
the guest of honour and Jerome K. Jerome was
the Chairman. As one of the original members
of the Club and as a member of the Executive
Committee, I was introduced to the great soldier.
All I expected was a bow, a handshake, and a
“How-do-you-do,” but Lord Roberts was as good
as to be more gracious and cordial than any great
soldier, even if an Irishman, ever was before&mdash;so at
least it seemed to me&mdash;to a scribbler of sorts, whom
he was meeting for the first time. He was, in fact,
so very kind that I was emboldened to ask a favour.
Among the guests was a young officer in what was
then the Artillery Volunteers. I knew it would
immensely gratify him to meet the Field-Marshal,
so towards the close of the conversation I ventured
to say:</p>

<p>“It has been a very great honour and pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Lord Roberts, to me to meet you and to have
this talk. I wonder whether you’ll think me trespassing
on your kindness if I ask to be allowed
to present an acquaintance of mine? He is a
Volunteer Officer, a junior subaltern in the Artillery,
and to meet you would, I am sure, be a red-letter
day in his life. Would you allow me to present
him?”</p>

<p>“Why of course. I shall be delighted. Bring
him along by all means,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The young man was accordingly presented.
The reader will hardly believe me when I say
that this Volunteer Subaltern of Artillery thought
well to instruct the Master Gunner in the science
of gunnery, and in fact to tell the Field-Marshal
what in his, the Volunteer Subaltern’s, opinion was
wrong with the British Army.</p>

<p>Had Lord Roberts replied civilly but curtly,
as some in his place would have done: “You think
so, do you? Oh indeed! Very interesting, I’m sure.
Good evening,” and walked away, one could
hardly have wondered. But no, he heard the other
out with perfect courtesy, if with resignation, and
in his own mind, no doubt, with amusement.</p>

<p>I reminded Lord Roberts of the incident when I
came to know him better, and he replied with a
laugh:</p>

<p>“I recall the matter perfectly, for I like to
think I have a retentive memory. Of course I was,
as you say, amused at the young man’s assurance
and confidence in his own military knowledge.
Many very young men are prone either to too great
diffidence or to too great assurance. I think, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the whole, I incline to envy the young man with
plenty of assurance, especially as I was disposed to
be diffident myself at his age, as many of us Irishmen,
for all our seeming confidence, are. But in any case
I owed it to you, who had introduced him, as well as
to myself, to treat him outwardly at least with
courtesy and consideration.”</p>

<p>That was Lord Roberts’ charming and kind way
of putting it; but to me, a young man myself when
the incident happened, it was a lesson in fine breeding
and in fine manners on the part of a great
soldier and great gentleman.</p>

<p>I heard afterwards that the Volunteer Subaltern
of Artillery, in speaking at a Distribution of Prizes
to members of his corps, the very evening following
upon his one and only meeting with the Field-Marshal,
made frequent use of such phrases as
“When I was talking to Lord Roberts about the
matter,” “What I told Lord Roberts ought to be
done,” and so on, no doubt to his own satisfaction and
possibly with the result that the members of the
audience were for the first time made to realise what
a very important figure he was in the military world.
Later on, however, some one who knew the facts
wrote to him suggesting that the book for which the
world was literally panting was a work from his
pen entitled <cite>My Recollections of Lord Roberts</cite>, and
when the Boer War broke out, a telegram, purporting
to come from Lord Roberts, urging the
Volunteer Artilleryman to take supreme command
in South Africa, was dispatched to him by a playful
friend. I have no doubt the young man, who will
now be getting elderly, would be the first to laugh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
at his own youthful self-confidence, and that if this
paper should by any chance meet his eye, he will
pardon me for thus, and for the first time, telling
the tale in print.</p>

<p>Here is an instance of Lord Roberts’ kindness to
and interest in younger men. A Territorial Captain&mdash;his
brother, an officer in the Regular Army, told
me the story&mdash;was taking part in a Field Day
with his battalion in Berkshire. His instructions
were that he was to hold a certain line of country
at all costs. It so happened that the attack developed
in a direction which made it necessary for him
hurriedly to advance his men to a flank and away
from his reserves, whom he had posted where they
were under cover and out of sight of the enemy.
The young officer (he was a junior subaltern recently
joined) in command of the reserves evidently had
very mistaken ideas in regard to discipline. His
idea appeared to be that discipline consists in
staying where you were originally told to stay,
like the “boy on the burning deck” in the poem
of <cite>Casabianca</cite>, until receiving orders to another
effect. Needless to say, the very reverse is true.
Soldiers to-day are taught clearly to observe events
and to act on their own initiative should unexpected
developments arise. Seeing that the tide of war
was drifting the Firing Line and its supports away
from the reserves, the duty of the officer commanding
the reserves was, not to remain stodgily where
he had originally been placed (to do that would be less
obedience to discipline than a breach of discipline),
but while keeping the reserves directly in signalling
communication with the Firing Line, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
under cover and out of sight of the enemy, so to
alter his own dispositions as to be ready to reinforce
and to reinforce quickly when called upon to do so.</p>

<p>This, however, he failed to do, and when his
superior officer, finding himself hard pressed,
signalled for the reserves, there was no reply.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was neither a galloper nor
a cyclist at hand to carry a message. “If I don’t
get my reserves here in half an hour,” he said, “I
shall lose the position, and the loss of this position
may mean, probably will mean, victory for the
enemy all along the line. It shan’t be so if I can
help it. Now what can I do?”</p>

<p>Hurriedly but keenly he scanned the rolling
Berkshire down around him. Towards the north,
on the whity-brown high road that curved outward
in a huge half-circle from the point where he was
standing, he saw a cloud of dust. “A motor!
and coming this way!” he exclaimed. “Follow
me, Brown.” (This to a non-commissioned officer.)
Stooping low, so as not to offer a target to the
enemy, he sprinted northwards in a line which
intersected the high road, at the nearest point which
the oncoming car must pass.</p>

<p>The motor was almost on him as he reached the
road, and leaping into the centre held up his hand.
“I beg your pardon, sir,” he said to the occupant,
“but I’m in command of troops holding this position.
We’re attacked in force, and my reserves are some
distance away along the road in the direction you
have come, near a copse. I’ve signalled for reinforcements,
but they have not kept up their communications.
I have neither a galloper nor a cyclist.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
If I get my reinforcements here in half an hour, I
can hold the position. If I don’t, I lose it, and
losing it means everything to the enemy. I wonder
whether you’d be so very good as to lend me
your car for a few minutes to carry a message!”
“With the greatest pleasure,” said the occupant.
Turning to the chauffeur he said, “You are entirely
at this officer’s disposal. I shall walk on, and you
can pick me up when he has done with you.”
As he spoke he got out of the car, and as he lifted
his cap, in response to the young officer’s salute
and hasty word of thanks, the latter recognised
Field-Marshal Lord Roberts.</p>

<p>A day or two later, the great soldier was celebrating
his eightieth birthday, and received a letter from
the officer in question. It was to remind Lord
Roberts of the incident, to apologise for the liberty
the young officer had taken in stopping the car, to
thank him warmly for his kindness, and to mention
that the reserves had been brought up at the
double and in time to save the position. The officer
concluded by asking to be allowed to congratulate
the Field-Marshal on attaining his eightieth year
and to express the hope that the great soldier might
be spared to celebrate many similar anniversaries.</p>

<p>A reply came almost by return of post.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Captain</span> &mdash;&mdash;,</p>

<p class="let">Many thanks for your letter and kind
congratulations on my 80th birthday. I was
delighted to be of assistance, and am even more
delighted to learn the successful result of that
assistance. You did the right and only thing in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
stopping my car. If ever you are this way and disengaged,
I hope you will call and give me the pleasure
of making the further acquaintance of so good and
resourceful a soldier.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Roberts</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>After my first meeting with Lord Roberts at the
Vagabond Club, I saw no more of him&mdash;except for
a mere handshake and “How-do-you-do?” at
a military function&mdash;for many years. Then I
chanced, in April, 1910, to contribute to the <cite>London
Quarterly Review</cite> an article on National Defence.
It was addressed specially to Nonconformists, one
of the opening paragraphs being as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do not for a moment believe that Nonconformists
are one whit less patriotic than any other
great religious body, but I fear there is some misconception
on their part&mdash;due no doubt to the
intolerance and the exaggeration of some of us who
champion the cause of National Defence&mdash;in regard
to our aims and our purposes. It is in the hope of
removing some of these misconceptions that I pen
the present paper.</p></blockquote>

<p>The article I did <em>not</em> send to Lord Roberts, nor
did I draw the attention of anyone connected with
the National Service League of which he was
President to it. I did nothing directly or indirectly
to bring it under anyone’s notice. Yet a few days
after the <em>Review</em> appeared, I received the following
letter from him. The Rev. R. Allen of whom he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
speaks, I may say, was, and still is, an entire stranger
to me, and I to him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Englemere, Ascot, Berks</span>,<br />
<span class="l2"><i>April 4, 1910</i>.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="let">The Rev. R. Allen, a friend of many years’
standing, has been good enough to send me a copy
of the <cite>London Quarterly Review</cite> for this month,
and to draw my attention to the first article, written
by you on “How to Defend England.”</p>

<p>I am <em>delighted</em> with the article itself, and with the
very clear and convincing way in which you have
put forward the advantages of military training and
discipline for all our able-bodied young men as
affecting not only the position of Great Britain as a
World Power, but the individual moral and physical
improvement of the men of the nation.</p>

<p>But I am still more delighted that such an article
should be allowed to appear in a Journal published
from the Wesleyan Book Room. I am quite at one
with you in believing that Nonconformists are not
one whit less patriotic than any other great religious
body, but that there is some misconception on their
part in regard to the aim and purpose of those who
advocate universal military training for Home
Defence.</p>

<p>My hope is that such misconception may be removed
and that every Briton, whatever his position
and whatever his sect, will realise the necessity for
taking the defence of his country seriously.</p>

<p>Such articles as yours will do much to effect this,
and to open the eyes of those who are now blind to
England’s needs and England’s dangers before it is
too late.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Roberts</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Other men as greatly concerned in great matters
as Lord Roberts was cannot always spare time
to acknowledge and to show appreciation of work
for a good cause, which is brought directly to their
notice. Lord Roberts could find time, or perhaps
I should say made time to write graciously about
work the doer or the author of which had done
nothing to bring that work under the Field-Marshal’s
eye.</p>

<p>Thenceforward, no work of mine in the cause for
National Defence was allowed to pass unrecognised,
once it came under the notice of Lord Roberts&mdash;and
not very much happened of which in some way
or another he did not come to hear.</p>

<p>He followed the doings even of the rank and file
under his command, and, like the great leader of men
that he was, he thought none of them too humble
to be honoured and heartened before going into
battle, by a message from himself.</p>

<p>For instance, I was asked to give an address on
National Defence to a great gathering of men&mdash;some
1500 or more as it turned out&mdash;at an Assault-at-Arms
in the Kursaal at Worthing. Naturally I
never trespassed upon such a busy man’s time by
writing to him, unless in answer to a letter from
himself, or unless I had something important of
which to speak. So as I had not heard from Lord
Roberts for some time, and had had no cause to
write to him, I did not suppose he as much as
knew of the Worthing meeting. Yet in opening
the proceedings, the Mayor announced that he had
just received a telegram from Lord Roberts to the
effect that he was delighted I was to be the speaker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
that night, and warmly commending what I had to
say to the attention of the audience.</p>

<p>Such a message and from such a quarter, did more
to assure me&mdash;an entire stranger to my audience&mdash;a
welcome and a friendly hearing than I could otherwise
have hoped to receive.</p>

<p>One “Lost Chord” in the way of an unread
message from Lord Roberts I often regret.</p>

<p>In the company of Mr. Neville P. Edwards, then
an organising secretary of the National Service
League, I went as an Honorary Helper of the League
on three caravan tours in Kent and Sussex.</p>

<p>The last tour closed only a week or two before the
outbreak of war, and Lord Roberts, who followed
our progress with the keenest interest, sent us on
several occasions by letter or by telegram a special
message to deliver in his name to our audiences.
These messages directly warned his fellow-countrymen
of the imminence of war and of the necessity
for preparation. Remembering that in the towns
we often had an audience of one or two thousand,
and even in the villages, of some hundreds, there
must be many persons who now recall the
weightiness and the gravity of the great soldier’s
words. And I venture to add that no one whose
privilege it was to hear them is likely ever to
forget the equally grave, eloquent, and memorable
words which fell from the lips of Mr. Rudyard
Kipling&mdash;who by his single pen has done more to
awaken the young manhood of the nation to
England’s needs than any other writer living or
dead&mdash;when he presided over one of our meetings.
It seemed to me one of the ironies of fate that in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
very caravan from which Lord Roberts’ message
and Mr. Kipling’s words&mdash;both urgent warnings of
imminent war&mdash;had been delivered, I should a few
weeks later set forth as an Honorary Recruiting
Officer in search of men to fight in the very war
which Lord Roberts and Mr. Kipling had so faithfully
foretold.</p>

<p>Before taking the chair and introducing Mr.
Edwards and myself to our audience, Mr. Kipling
said to me:</p>

<p>“I have just had a telegram from the Chief.
He sent his thanks to me for presiding at the
meeting, and asks that I convey his thanks to
Edwards and to you. It is a very interesting and
characteristic message, and I will read it when
making my closing remarks to the meeting at the
end.”</p>

<p>It so happened that the latter part of the
meeting was a Lantern Slide Lecture by Mr.
Edwards. His last slide was a portrait of the King,
seeing which some one started “God Save the
King,” and the audience, taking this as ending the
meeting, broke up, and so we lost not only Lord
Roberts’ telegram, but Mr. Kipling’s equally
coveted closing words.</p>

<p>In nothing that I attempted for the cause that
was so near to his heart, was Lord Roberts more
keenly interested than in a controversy in the spring
and summer of 1914 between an opponent of
National Service, a very distinguished divine and
scholar, and myself. My opponent’s article was
headed, “Why we cannot accept conscription,”
and mine “Why we support Lord Roberts.” To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
a reprint of the controversy in booklet form, published
immediately after the outbreak of war, the
Rev. John Telford, B.A., contributed an Editorial
Foreword, in which he said:</p>

<p>“This discussion of the question of national armaments
aroused extraordinary interest among a very
wide circle of readers, as it appeared in <cite>The Magazine
of the Wesleyan Methodist Church</cite> in March, April, May
and June of this year. It also led to much correspondence
in other journals. No one then dreamed
of the terrible significance which events were to
attach to the subject.... Here are Mr. Kernahan’s
words, printed last March, before any shadow had
fallen across the sun. He says: ‘I have studied
the question at home and abroad with as much closeness
as was possible, and the more closely I study
it the more convinced I am that we are well within
the possibility of one of the most awful disasters
that ever befell a great nation.’ In the light of to-day
that is a remarkably verified warning.”</p>

<p>This controversy, on account of the importance
attached to the issues involved, Lord Roberts
followed with exceptional interest. One passage of
arms between my opponent and myself I may be
permitted to quote, since it centres around Lord
Roberts himself.</p>

<p>“Mr. Kernahan proves,” my critic wrote,
“that his special hero, Lord Roberts, is a truly
Christian man. I would not question it for a
moment. And yet&mdash;so terrible a power has familiarity
with war to blind men’s eyes to its satanic
wickedness&mdash;it was Lord Roberts who uttered in
our Free Trade Hall at Manchester the cynical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
sentence about Germany’s right to strike when her
hour came, which shocked even convinced conscriptionists
on his platform. I wonder whether
Lord Roberts approved of the way Germany struck
when her hour came in 1870! Strange indeed to
hear a Christian man echoing the very sentiments
of Bismarck, who was so proud of the cunning lie
by which he tricked France into a disastrous war!”</p>

<p>My reply I venture to quote, since Lord Roberts
was so good as to say it exactly interpreted his
views and his position.</p>

<p>“Lord Roberts,” I wrote, “claimed no such
‘right’ for any nation wantonly and wickedly to
force war upon another. He pointed out that when
one nation has decided, for reasons of her own
(possibly because she is ambitious and determined
to play a great part in history), to force a war upon
another nation, which possibly may decide to resist,
if only because she is determined to hold to her own&mdash;the
policy is that adopted by Germany. That
policy&mdash;as a student of history as well as a soldier,
Lord Roberts had to admit that it is often a winning
policy&mdash;is to strike at what has been called the
selected moment, or in other words, when she
(Germany) is at her strongest, and the nation which
she wishes to overthrow is weak. It was because
Lord Roberts knew that this was and is Germany’s
policy, and because he wellnigh despairs sometimes
at the criminal apathy of his fellow-countrymen, and
because he knows the consequences which must
almost inevitably follow, that he felt compelled,
under a terrible sense of responsibility, to speak out
thus plainly. Had he, knowing what he does of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Germany’s ambitions, intentions, and strength, and
of England’s ignorance, weakness, and unpreparedness,
elected to maintain a cowardly and traitorous
silence&mdash;then, and not till then, would he be guilty
of the ‘cynical’ and ‘satanic’ wickedness of which
my opponent speaks.... For the latter cannot
deny that Germany has not gone back in her ambition
or in her strength since 1870. On the contrary,
she has gone on, not only in piling up an army
which, as Mr. Churchill warned the nation, is now
four and a half millions in number, but also in the
most strenuous effort to create a vast Navy, which
she has said must be, shall be, greater than ours.
With her huge army she needs no Navy for defence.
It is, as has been said, a ‘luxury’ and is meant for
attack, whereas to us a Navy is a matter of life and
death. And my opponent knows that we have twice
held out the hand of friendship to Germany with
proposals to stay this insane race in armaments,
and that her reply was more battleships, more
soldiers, more guns.”</p>

<p>I do not print this passage here to reopen
an old controversy, but because&mdash;though the
details of Lord Roberts’ proposals will, in the light
of recent events, require considerable modification&mdash;the
main issues raised by him abide and must be
reaffirmed. Here in England we have short memories.
It is possible that in the bewildering happenings
of the war and in the breathless interest with
which, at its end, the shifting of frontiers and the
striking of great balances will be watched, there
is the danger, if only from reaction, that we slackly
fall back into our previous national inertia and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
national apathy, and that the little puddles of party
politics (dirty puddles for the most part) once again
matter more to us than to hold sacred and inviolate
the great Empire and these world-trusts which God
has seen well to commit to Britain’s charge.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>I have heard many noble tributes paid to Lord
Roberts, but I remember none which touched him
more than that of Sir William Robertson Nicoll at
the Whitefriars’ Club. Lord Roberts was the club
guest, that brilliant author and journalist Mr. John
Foster Fraser being Chairman. I had the honour
of being in the Vice-Chair.</p>

<p>The toast of Lord Roberts’ health was seconded
by Sir William Robertson Nicoll, who was meeting
the Field-Marshal for the first time. The Whitefriars’
dinner to Lord Roberts was merely a compliment
to a great soldier. Not all of those present
would have shared the views he entertained upon
the question of National Service, and controversial
issues were carefully excluded. Speaking, therefore,
of Lord Roberts as a soldier, as a writer, and as a
man, Sir William Robertson Nicoll, in one of the
most graceful and generous tributes to which I have
ever listened, assured him that by no class was our
guest held in greater honour and affection than by
the Nonconformists of this country and of every
denomination. Lord Roberts knew that many
Nonconformists differed from him in politics and
upon the question of National Service, of which he
was the acknowledged champion, and Sir William’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
tribute so gracefully phrased, so obviously sincere
in its expression of personal reverence and affection,
touched and gratified him deeply.</p>

<p>That he felt a little sore, in regard to the misunderstanding
of his views by some Nonconformists, is
clear, I think, from a letter to me which lies before
me as I write.</p>

<p>I happen to be a Churchman myself, but for the
last eight or nine years before the war I devoted no
inconsiderable portion of my time in trying to put
the case for National Defence, as advocated by the
Field-Marshal, before my many friends in the Nonconformist
Churches, and I am glad and grateful to
remember that, while not sharing my views, the
editors of the great Nonconformist and Free Church
organs gave me for the most part&mdash;there were exceptions&mdash;full
opportunity to “state a case.” In April,
1913, a prominent Free Churchman of Hastings
asked me to speak at the Brotherhood meeting in
that town. I told him frankly that I dislike public
speaking, but would do so if I were permitted to
speak upon the subject of National Defence. My
friend demurred, but it was finally arranged that I
should first give a reading from a tiny booklet of my
own, and after that I should speak for twenty
minutes on the subject that lay so near my heart.</p>

<p>As this was the first occasion upon which an
address upon National Defence was to be given at
a Brotherhood meeting, Lord Roberts took deep
interest in the matter. He was, indeed, so anxious
to remove any misunderstanding which existed that
he sent me a special message to deliver in his name
to my audience. The message was in the form of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
letter to myself, and as it puts his views very
plainly, I print it here in full.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Englemere, Ascot,<br />
<span class="l1">Berks, 12.4.13.</span></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I am very glad to learn that when asked to
speak at the Brotherhood Meeting which is to take
place in your own town on Sunday the 20th instant,
you refused to do so unless you were allowed to deal
with the question of National Service.</p>

<p>I know that there are many very well-meaning
people who think that all military training is an
abomination, and who are convinced that the life
of youth in barracks is a continued round of vice
and immorality of all kinds. I am prepared to admit
that this certainly was true 200 years ago, and
possibly it was true even at the beginning of the last
century. During Marlborough’s wars we know from
history that the ranks of the Regular Army were
filled up by taking broken men of all kinds, and
forcing them into the service.</p>

<p>Any man who was really on his last legs&mdash;broken
debtors, tramps and vagabonds, condemned felons&mdash;these
and such as these were forced into the
ranks. Can it be wondered if the Army got a bad
name? and, as we know, there is nothing so hard
to live down as a really evil reputation. But all
this is changed and has been changed for some
years. Have we not heard that the Chief Constable
of the county of Cambridge announced, after the
Army manœuvres, that although 45,000 men had
been turned loose in the area for which he was responsible,
yet not a single accusation for wrongdoing
had been brought against any of these
soldiers? Have not the papers just recently told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
us that 10,000 men taken at random from the
garrison at Aldershot have been billeted upon the
inhabitants in the Hartley district, that these men
were willingly received by the people of the district
in their houses, and that again, in this instance,
there has not been one complaint of misconduct?
I must confess that I am pained, as well as surprised,
when I find that those who profess, and profess very
loudly, that they are followers of Christ, should still
look upon the defenders of their country with such
unchristian suspicion and dislike.</p>

<p>I should like you to read out to the meeting the
following extract which occurs in an article on
“Germany and the Germans,” by Mr. Price Collier.
It can be found in the current issue of <cite>Scribner’s
Magazine</cite>: “Military training makes youths better
and stronger citizens and produces that self-respect,
self-control and cosmopolitan sympathy which more
than aught else lessen the chances of conflict. I can
vouch for it that there are fewer personal jealousies,
bickerings, quarrels, in the mess room or below
decks of a warship, or in a soldiers’ camp, than in
many Church and Sunday School assemblies, in
many club smoking-rooms, in many ladies’ sewing
and reading circles. Nothing does away more surely
with quarrelsomeness than the training of men to
get on together comfortably. Each giving way a
little in the narrow lanes of life, so that each may
pass without moral shoving. There are no such
successful schools for the teaching of this fundamental
diplomacy as the sister-services: the Army
and the Navy.”</p>

<p>Here is another extract [Lord Roberts then goes
on himself] from a New Zealand paper which was
forwarded to me by a friend in that Dominion:
“The Rev. W. Ready, the well-known Methodist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Minister, took up a strong stand on the subject of
military training at a meeting of the Society of
Friends held in Auckland last week. Mr. Ready,
who was present by invitation, was taken to task
for some remarks he had made on the subject at the
recent Methodist Conference. He thereupon explained
to the meeting his attitude at the Conference.
There was a time, he had told the Conference, when
he held the opinion that camps were very immoral,
and not places to which youths should be sent; but
since he had had his sons attending camp as Territorials,
he had been converted into believing that
these camps were moral and were well-regulated.
Every instinct of his moral nature went against
compulsory training, but he had his sons in the
Territorials. At this point there were cries of
‘Shame’ from the assembled members of the
Society of Friends, but Mr. Ready stuck to his guns
and declared that he was not going to advise his
boys to break the law, merely because he objected
on principle to military training. The Defence Act
was now the law of the land, and he would no more
advocate his sons breaking the law than he would
support the English Suffragettes in their militant
tactics. This is both sound ethics and common
sense, and Mr. Ready has done the community a
service in emphasising the duty of every man to
obey the law. The change in his opinions on the
subject of camps is interesting and gratifying, and
should be noted by those who profess to be so concerned
about their evil influences.”</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that your discourse at the
Brotherhood Meeting will help to dissipate the
suspicions against military life and all connected
with it.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Roberts</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Lord Roberts made some appreciative remarks
about my own work in the cause of National
Defence. These I took the liberty of omitting when
reading his letter at the Brotherhood Meeting, and
I venture to follow a similar course in transcribing
it here. Otherwise this very interesting letter
is given exactly as he wrote it.</p>

<p>That the great soldier should, in his eighty-first
year, have been at the pains to write so
lengthy a letter for one of the rank and file, merely,
of his supporters to read at a meeting held in a
Nonconformist Church, bears witness not only to
Lord Roberts’ unwearying energies, but also to his
earnest desire, one might even say his anxiety,
that the case for National Defence should be fully
and fairly put before his fellow Britons of the Free
Churches. Had he lived to see the magnificent
response made by every denomination of the Free
Churches&mdash;not even excepting some members of
the Society of Friends&mdash;in sending the flower of its
young manhood to the heroic task of subduing
the monster of Prussian militarism, it would have
added gladness and thankfulness to his “Nunc
Dimittis,” when within sound of the guns the hero-soul
of the great soldier, patriot and Christian,
passed into the presence of his God.</p>

<p>Here I may perhaps be allowed to say a word
about a prayer which has often been attributed to
Lord Roberts, and was in fact, soon after his death,
printed by a leading religious journal as “composed
by the late Lord Roberts and presented by him
to the soldiers serving under his command in the
South African war.” The same prayer has repeatedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
been attributed to Lord Roberts in magazines, books
and newspapers; and, as the correspondence which
I have permission to quote will show, I shall be
following Lord Roberts’ own wishes in doing what
I can, once and for all, to set the matter right.</p>

<p>Here is the prayer as given in the religious
journal of which I have spoken:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Almighty Father, I have often sinned against
Thee. Oh, wash me in the precious blood of the
Lamb of God. Fill me with Thy Holy Spirit, that
I may lead a new life. Spare me to see again those
whom I love at home, or fit me for Thy presence in
peace. Strengthen us to quit ourselves like men in
our right and just cause. Keep us faithful unto
death, calm in danger, patient in suffering, merciful
as well as brave; true to our Queen, our country,
and colours. If it be Thy will, enable us to win
victory for England; but, above all, grant us a
better victory over temptation and sin, over life
and death, that we may be more than conquerors,
through Him who loved us and laid down His life
for us, Jesus our Saviour, the Captain of the Army
of God. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first appearance of the prayer as by Lord
Roberts was, I believe, in a volume published some
years ago at Kansas City, U.S.A., and edited by
Dr. Stephen Abbott Northrop. It was entitled
<cite>A Cloud of Witnesses</cite>, and I had from the first
my suspicions about the prayer’s authenticity,
for, though I never think or thought of Lord
Roberts as other than a deeply religious man, I
found it difficult to think of him as one who elected
to write prayers for publication. Mentioning the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
matter to Lord Roberts himself one day, I found
him very much mystified by what he heard. “I
have not the slightest recollection of ever writing
a prayer,” he protested, and, later on, when writing
on another matter, he recurred to the subject,
asking me if I could send him a copy of the prayer.
I did so, and received the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Almond’s Hotel, Clifford Street,<br />
<span class="l1">London, W.</span></span>
</p>

<p>(The only undated letter I ever remember receiving
from Lord Roberts.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I am afraid I cannot claim the honour of
writing the beautiful prayer you found in the
<cite>Cloud of Witnesses</cite>&mdash;at least I think that is the
name of the book you mentioned&mdash;but I am away
from home and have not got your letter by me.</p>

<p>I thought it might have been the prayer General
Colley wrote before “Majuba,” but it is not.</p>

<p>I should like to find out where the author of the
book got the prayer, and why he gave me as the
writer of it.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Roberts</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>My reply was to send Lord Roberts the book to
see for himself. He returned it, carefully packed
and addressed in his own handwriting, with the
letter which I here transcribe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Almond’s Hotel, Clifford Street,<br />
<span class="l2">London, W., 1.2.14.</span></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I return <cite>A Cloud of Witnesses</cite> with many
thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
It is very curious about the prayer. I have no
recollection of writing it, and I am wondering how
Dr. Abbott Northrop got hold of it. What a fine
collection of sentiments and opinions he has got
together!</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Roberts</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>There, so far as I was concerned, the matter
dropped, but when next I saw Lord Roberts he again
expressed his curiosity in regard to the mystery by
which the prayer was attributed to him, and his
desire to unravel it, asking me if I heard any more
of it to let him know.</p>

<p>That I was of some service to him in the matter
was due more to chance than to any mystery-unravelling
merit of my own.</p>

<p>A friend who is interested in religious work among
soldiers lent me a little book, with the request that
I would look into it and return it at my leisure.
I opened the volume somewhat indifferently, and
the first thing to catch my eye was the very prayer
which Lord Roberts and I had been discussing. The
book stated that it had been written by the late
Archbishop Alexander for the use of the troops in
South Africa, and so exactly expressed the faith and
feelings of Lord Roberts that he had it printed at
his own cost and sent it to his various officers,
asking them to distribute it to all ranks under their
command.</p>

<p>That the prayer was ultimately attributed to the
Field-Marshal instead of to the Archbishop I
diagnose thus: Even though “Tommy” was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
specifically informed that it was composed by
Archbishop Alexander&mdash;to “Tommy” that information
meant little or nothing. But to “Tommy”
the fact that it had been specially sent to him by
his beloved “Bobs” would mean everything; and
so, no doubt, it became known as “Lord Roberts’
prayer,” and as “Lord Roberts’ prayer” it came
to the knowledge of the editor of <cite>A Cloud of Witnesses</cite>,
and was printed in good faith by him over
the Field-Marshal’s signature in that book, whence
it was reproduced, equally in good faith, in other
prints.</p>

<p>But to recur to the little book in which I found
the prayer attributed, and rightly, to the Archbishop.
With the owner’s permission I sent it to
Lord Roberts to see for himself how, in my opinion&mdash;and
he entirely agreed with me&mdash;the mistake
originally arose. His reply has a characteristic
touch, for though he went out to South Africa
to take supreme command, his soldier-like way of
putting it is “When I was ordered out.” Nor is
the reference to failing memory without pathos to
those whose smallest service to the cause he had
so at heart&mdash;National Defence&mdash;was never forgotten
by one of the greatest-hearted and most generous
of men and of chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I cannot think how I could have forgotten

</p></blockquote>

<p>My next meeting with Lord Roberts was twelve
days later, and was at No. 10 Downing Street, Mr.
Asquith’s official residence. Lord Roberts said,
among other things, in the talk we had together on
that occasion that he was very much indebted to me
for the promptness with which I had unravelled the
mystery about himself and the Archbishop, and
went on gravely:</p>

<p>“I very much dislike having attributed to me
a prayer which I did not write. It is not, as
you know, that I do not believe in prayer. I
have humbly asked God’s help and guidance
in everything that I undertook all through my
life, and never more so than now, when I am an old
man, and His call may be very near. But&mdash;&mdash;” he
hesitated a moment, “offering up a brief prayer&mdash;it
may only be the words ‘God help me!’&mdash;before
going into action, or in some time of difficulty,
is one thing; and sitting down to write, to print
and publish a prayer for others is quite another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
thing&mdash;for a soldier, at least. That was why I asked
my friend the Archbishop to compose the prayer.
It was for him, God’s minister, a clergyman, not
for me, a soldier, to do it.”</p>

<p>Lord Roberts then asked me to advise him how
best to prevent a recurrence of the error by which
the prayer was attributed to him. I replied that
if he wished I would on his behalf write to the editor
of <cite>A Cloud of Witnesses</cite> pointing out the mistake,
and suggesting that an erratum slip, making the
correction, be inserted in all copies of the book
already printed, and that the Archbishop’s name
replace that of Lord Roberts in any future edition.</p>

<p>“I shall be so much obliged if you will,” he said
gratefully. “May I leave it to you, and will you
let me know when you hear from him?”</p>

<p>I promised to do so, and carried the promise into
effect, sending Lord Roberts, when I received it,
the editor’s reply, in which, after expressing regret
for the error, he undertook to do what was proposed.
That Lord Roberts felt strongly about the matter,
and was most anxious that the correction should
be made, will be seen by the following letter which
I received the morning after I had seen him at
Downing Street:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Englemere, Ascot, Berks</span>,<br />
<span class="l2"><i>28th Feb., 1914</i>.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">Thanks for your letter of the 21st instant and
for sending me the little book, which I wish I could
have kept. Would it be possible to communicate
with the author of the book you sent me in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the prayer of the Primate of Ireland appeared under
my name? I should like to have this corrected, as
it is quite wrong that I should have the credit of
being the author of such a beautiful prayer when I
was only the indirect means of it being written.</p>

<p>(Thus far Lord Roberts’ letter was typed. Then
in his own strong, clear, firm hand the letter concluded
as follows): This letter was dictated before
I met you yesterday. I only send it as a reminder.</p></blockquote>

<p>I may just add in conclusion that “the little
book” which he twice, almost wistfully, said he
wished he could have kept (if I remember rightly
it told, among other things, of his son’s death
in South Africa) was by the courtesy of the friend
from whom I had borrowed it, reforwarded to Lord
Roberts, and was by him gratefully and gladly
acknowledged.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Even as an old man&mdash;though none of us who
knew and loved him could ever bring ourselves to
think of Lord Roberts as old&mdash;his energy was amazing,
and the amount of work he got through was
stupendous. His mere correspondence alone would
have kept any other man going all day and with no
moment to spare for the many great issues with
which his name was connected. He accomplished
so much because he practised in his own life the
organisation, if not indeed the National Service which
he preached to the nation&mdash;the organisation which,
as he foresaw, would be so tremendous a driving
power behind Germany when the time came for her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
to force a war upon this country, the war which
he even more clearly foresaw.</p>

<p>As an instance of how Lord Roberts systematised
his days, I may mention that a friend of mine and
his, recently returned from Bulgaria, wished to see
him to put certain military facts before him,
and also, if I remember rightly, to present him
with some interesting trophies of the war which he
knew the Field-Marshal would prize. He wrote
accordingly and asked for an appointment. Lord
Roberts replied by return of post, from Almond’s
Hotel, Clifford Street, W., to say that he was then
in town but was returning to Ascot the following
day. “If it will be saving you a railway journey&mdash;and
I know what a busy man you are,” he wrote,
“to see me here at the Hotel, instead of at Ascot,
by all means let it be so. But I am afraid, if not too
early for you, it must be at 8.30 in the morning, as
the rest of my day is already mapped out.”</p>

<p>My friend smiled sadly in telling me the story.
“As a matter of fact,” he said, “8.30, and even
later, generally sees me tubbing, shaving, or at best
breakfasting, but if 8.30 was not too early for a
great soldier who had turned 80 to be up, and ready
to receive visitors, I could hardly plead that 8.30
was too early for me,” and the appointment was
made.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Like most Irishmen, Lord Roberts had a keen
sense of humour. At a public dinner at which I was
present he had for a near neighbour, at the high
table, Lord Willoughby de Broke, who in his after-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>dinner
speech had occasion to refer to the Territorial
Army.</p>

<p>“If I am asked,” he said, “whether a young man
should join the Territorial Army, my answer is
invariably ‘Yes,’ and for three reasons. The first
reason is that he will, perhaps for the first time in
his life, be coming under the salutary influence of
Discipline, and I say confidently and without fear
of contradiction, that there is no finer influence for
a young fellow than that of Discipline.”</p>

<p>These were sentiments that appealed to a soldier,
and of the many approving cries of “Hear! Hear!”
which came from all parts of the room, none rang
more whole-heartedly than those of Lord Roberts.</p>

<p>“My second reason,” went on the speaker, “is
that the young man will thereby be discharging a
patriotic duty. To-day we are all thinking too much
of our rights, rarely of our responsibilities, and in my
opinion every able-bodied young fellow, whether he
be a duke’s son, a draper’s son, or the son of a
costermonger, should be trained to defend his
country against an invader in her hour of
need.”</p>

<p>Once again Lord Willoughby de Broke was
expressing the very sentiments with which Lord
Roberts’ name was so closely associated, and again
it was the great soldier’s “Hear! Hear!” which
was most emphatic.</p>

<p>“And lastly,” concluded the speaker, “my
reason for advising every young fellow to join the
Territorial Army is that it gives him a chance of&mdash;getting
away from his wife for a night or a week or
a fortnight without putting him to the trouble of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
hashing up some silly excuse which she knows is as
palpably a fake and a lie as he does himself.”</p>

<p>Thus far Lord Willoughby de Broke had spoken
with such grave earnestness that we were all prepared
as heartily to endorse his third reason as his
previous ones. Lord Roberts had, in fact, raised
his right hand above his left to applaud when the
speaker sprang this surprise upon us, and especially
upon those of us who were married, for the dinner
was graced by the presence of Lady Willoughby de
Broke and Lady Roberts, as well as by other ladies,
the wives, daughters, and sisters of those present.</p>

<p>For one second the company, if I may so phrase
it, “gaped” open-mouthed at the trap into which
they had been led, and then there was a great roar
of laughter, in which no one more heartily joined
than did Lady Willoughby de Broke, Lady Roberts,
and Lord Roberts himself.</p>

<p>I recall another and grimmer instance of Lord
Roberts’ sense of humour. On February 27, 1914,
he introduced to the Prime Minister a Deputation
whose object was to plead the cause of National
Service. When I say that it was a great occasion
I am not expressing my own opinion, but that of a
distinguished member of the Deputation who has
since written and published in pamphlet form an
official account of the proceedings.</p>

<p>“Those of us who look forward,” he writes, “to
an early fruition of the hopes which we have
cherished and the aims for which we have worked
for so many years past, will ever look back upon
Friday, the 27th of February, 1914, as a milestone,
a red-letter day in the History of National Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
“All the circumstances conspired to stamp a
great occasion with the greatness which belonged to
it. The importance of the Cause needs no illustration
from the present writer. In Lord Roberts’ well-known
words, ‘National Service means not only
national safety; it means national health, national
strength, national honour, and national prosperity.’</p>

<p>“The Deputation included some of the greatest
and most distinguished men of the day, and&mdash;a
most significant and important factor&mdash;the greatness
was in nearly every case not inherited but achieved
by conspicuous service in the fields of national and
imperial endeavour. Three Field-Marshals, including
our veteran leader who has carried our flag to
victory with honour in Asia and Africa and served
King and country for fifty-five years; two Admirals
of the Fleet, one of whom was in command of
the International Forces at Crete, and the other
commanded the International Naval Forces in
China at the time of the Boxer Rebellion; an ex-Viceroy
of India, prominent representatives of the
Church and of Nonconformity; the editor of one
of the most influential weeklies, and representatives
of literature, science, and industry.”</p>

<p>Of this Deputation I was, by Lord Roberts’
personal invitation and wish, a member, and as I
arrived in good time I had an opportunity of some
conversation with him in the ante-room before we
passed into the Library in which Mr. Asquith
was to receive us.</p>

<p>Seeing that one of his hands was swathed in
bandages, I inquired the reason.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,” he said smilingly. “I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
often been accused of having too many irons in the
fire, but this time it is a case of having a hand too
much in the fire. Just before leaving my hotel this
morning, my foot slipped on the marble paving of
the hall, and in falling forward and trying to save
myself, I thrust my hand between the bars of the
fire, and so got a bit of a burn. But it’s a mere
nothing, and of no consequence.”</p>

<p>So far from being, as Lord Roberts said, a mere
nothing, I have since heard that the burn was, on the
contrary, excessively painful, but all through the
lengthy and trying ordeal of introducing the different
members of the Deputation, listening to, and commenting
upon what was said, as well as listening to
and replying to the Prime Minister’s very important
and brilliantly able speech, Lord Roberts was the
alertest, cheeriest, and most watchful of those
present. A burn that would have distressed and
possibly have distracted the attention of a much
younger man, and that must necessarily have caused
constant and severe pain, the gallant old soldier, then
nearing his 82nd year, treated as of no consequence
and dismissed with a lightly uttered jest. To the
last it was of others, never of himself, that he
thought. On this particular occasion he was
pleading (to use his own words) “as plainly as an
old man has the right to speak, in the face of
emergencies which would be far less terrible to
him personally than to generations of Britons yet
unborn.” That was not many months before his
death, and though I saw and talked with Field-Marshal
Earl Roberts, V.C., on other and later
occasions, I shall to my life’s end picture him as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
saw him then&mdash;his burned and bandaged hand
throbbing with pain of which he showed no single
sign, thrust behind him and out of sight, as
eloquently, gravely, almost passionately, he warned
his hearers of a possible national disaster, the consequences
of which would be “far less terrible to
him personally than to generations of Britons yet
unborn.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_67" class="vspace">THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON<br />
AS THE “OGRE OF THE ‘ATHENÆUM’”</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was, I believe, George Meredith who, when
the author of <cite>Aylwin</cite> changed his name from
Theodore Watts to Theodore Watts-Dunton,
spoke of him as “Theodore What’s-his-name,” and
added that he supposed his friend had made the
change lest posterity might confound Watts the
poet with Watts the hymn writer.</p>

<p>Posterity, unlike Popularity&mdash;who plays the
wanton at times and cohabits with unlawful mates&mdash;keeps
chaste her house from generation to generation
and needs no hint from us to assist her choice.
Her task is to rescue reputations from the dust, no
less than to “pour forgetfulness upon the dead,”
and none of us alive to-day may predict what surprise
of lost or rescued reputations Posterity may
have in store.</p>

<p>Over one of these reputations it is surely possible
to imagine Posterity&mdash;I will not disrespectfully say
scratching a puzzled head, but at least wrinkling in
perplexity her learned brows. She will discover when
straightening out her dog’s-eared literary annals
that the name of one writer, who at the beginning
of the last decade of the nineteenth century had
a great if somewhat esoteric reputation among his
brother authors, was not then to be found in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
publisher’s list, and for the somewhat curious and
incontinent reason that at that time he had published
no book. It was not until the publication of <cite>Aylwin</cite>
that the name of Theodore Watts, or as he afterwards
elected to be called Watts-Dunton, became
widely known outside what are sometimes not very
felicitously described as “literary circles.”</p>

<p>To-day the tremendous issues of the Great War
have, as it were, at a besom stroke of the gods,
brushed into one box, to set aside, upon a shelf, all
the trappings, furniture and paraphernalia of non-industrial
arts and the like. Authors, artists, actors,
musicians, professors, as well as the mere politician,
are, and rightly, relegated to the back of the stage
of life, and it is the soldier and the sailor&mdash;not by
their own seeking&mdash;who bulk biggest in the public
eye. But in those days of little things&mdash;the last
decade of the last century&mdash;and outside the so-called
“literary circle” of which I have spoken,
there were other and outer circles of men and
women much more keenly interested in books and
authors, especially in the personality of literary
celebrities, than would be possible in these days of
tragic and tremendous world-issues. In such circles
many curious, interesting and even romantic
associations were woven around the name of
Theodore Watts.</p>

<p>He was known to be the personal friend of Tennyson,
Matthew Arnold, James Russell Lowell, Browning,
and William Morris. Dante Gabriel Rossetti
and George Meredith had in the past made their
home with him at Chelsea, and Swinburne had been
his house mate for many years at Putney. Rossetti<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and Swinburne had written and spoken of him in
terms which to outsiders seem extravagant, and both
had dedicated some of their best work to him. It
was also known that he had lived for some time with
gipsies, was one of the three greatest living authorities
on gipsy lore and the gipsy language, and had
been the friend of George Borrow. This curiosity
was stimulated by the fact that Watts-Dunton was
then very rarely seen at literary dinners or functions,
and was supposed more studiously even to avoid
publicity than some of his craft who might be
named were supposed to seek it. Cryptic allusions
in the literary journals, reviews, and magazines to a
long-completed novel, deliberately and cruelly withheld
from publication, and tributes to his encyclopædic
knowledge, did not a little to increase this
curiosity.</p>

<p>Thus far the reputation which Theodore Watts
had attained did not altogether belie him, but there
was yet another “Theodore Watts”&mdash;“Watts of
the <cite>Athenæum</cite>” he was sometimes called&mdash;who had
no existence except in the imagination of certain
small literary fry by whom he was popularly supposed
to be something of a “Hun” of the pen, a
shark of the literary seas, who preyed upon suckling
poets. I remember a morning in the early nineties,
when I was to lunch at Putney with Watts-Dunton
and Swinburne. Being in the neighbourhood of
Temple Bar about eleven, I turned in for a cup of
coffee and a cigarette at a famous Coffee House,
then much frequented by editors, journalists, poets,
rising authors and members of the literary staff of
the publishing houses and newspaper offices in or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
around Fleet Street, as well as by members of the
legal profession from the Temple and the New Law
Courts.</p>

<p>At the next table sat a young man with long hair,
a velveteen jacket and a flowing tie. He was talking
so loudly to a friend, that unless one stopped
one’s ears there was no choice but to overhear the
conversation.</p>

<p>“Seen this week’s <cite>Athenæum</cite>?” he asked his
friend.</p>

<p>“Not yet. Anything particular in it?” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Only a review of my poems.”</p>

<p>“Good?”</p>

<p>“Bad as it can be&mdash;bad, that is, as four contemptuous
lines of small print can make it. A book,
which as you know represents the thought, the
passion and soul-travail of years; a book written
in my heart’s blood&mdash;and dismissed by the <cite>Athenæum</cite>
in four contemptuous lines!”</p>

<p>There was a pause too brief, if not too deep for
tears. Then: “Theodore Watts, of course!” he
added between set teeth. “I expected it. Everyone
knows he is so insanely jealous of us younger
men that he watches the publishers’ lists for every
book by a young poet of ability to pounce upon it,
and to cut it up. What has he done, I should like to
know, to give him the right to pronounce death
sentences? Why, the fellow’s never even published
a book of his own.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you why? He <em>daren’t</em>. There
is a novel called <cite>Aylwin</cite> written and ready
to publish many years ago. Murray has offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
him a small fortune in advance royalties, I
hear.”</p>

<p>Again the young man paused dramatically and
looked darkly around the room, not apparently
from fear of his being overheard, but because he
wished to invite attention to the inner and exclusive
knowledge which he possessed. Then, in an ecstasy
of anger that had a fine disregard for so trivial a
matter as a confusion of metaphors, he thundered:</p>

<p>“Because that viper Theodore Watts has stabbed
so many of us in the back anonymously in the
<cite>Athenæum</cite>, he daren’t bring out his novel. He
can never say anything bad enough about a ‘minor
poet,’ as he scornfully calls us, but he knows that
some of us do a little reviewing, and that we are
waiting for him to publish his book that we may get
a bit of our own back.”</p>

<p>It so happened that I had in my pocket that morning
a letter from Watts-Dunton deprecating the
slating in the <cite>Athenæum</cite> of a book of minor poetry
by a friend of mine, and I remembered a sentence
in the letter. “By minor poet, meaning apparently
a new and unknown poet,” which prefaced a generous
if discriminating and critical appreciation of my
friend’s poems.</p>

<p>To intrude into a conversation between strangers
was, of course, as much out of the question as to make
known to others, without first obtaining the writer’s
permission, the contents of a letter written to myself.
Otherwise I could easily have convinced the
aggrieved young poet, not only that it was not Theodore
Watts who had cut up his book, but that so
far from being a literary Herod and a slayer of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
poetic innocent, he was, as a matter of fact, Herod’s
literary antithesis. As the writer of the letter and
those mentioned in it are no longer with us, no harm
can be done by printing part of it here:</p>

<p>“Like the rest of us, our Philip was mortal, and,
like all of us, he could be harsh. I got Maccoll to let
him review the minor bards. He was so terribly
severe upon most of them that I was miserable; and
I fear that I had to ask Maccoll to be chary in sending
them to him, or at least I got M. to remonstrate
with him for his extreme and unaccountable harshness.
My sympathies, as you know, are all with the
younger men. I love to see a young poet, or for the
matter of that <em>any</em> young writer, get recognition.</p>

<p>“Robinson is the only fogey-brother I boom.
Please tell him when you see him that if I do not
write to him much, it is not because of any cooling
of love. Thirty years ago he knew me for the worst
correspondent in the world. The first letter he ever
wrote to me (in sending me his novel <cite>No Church</cite>) I
answered at the end of six months. I wish I could
help it, but I can’t. My friends have to take me
with all my infirmities on my head.”</p>

<p>“Our Philip,” I may say, was Philip Bourke
Marston, the blind poet; “Robinson” was F.&nbsp;W.
Robinson, the novelist&mdash;both friends of Watts-Dunton
and mine&mdash;“Maccoll” was the then editor
of the <cite>Athenæum</cite>.</p>

<p>Had I known Watts-Dunton better (it was in the
early days of our long friendship that this Coffee
House incident happened), I should studiously have
refrained from mentioning the matter to him. But
thinking it would do no more than amuse him, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
was so unwise as to tell the story over the luncheon
table. Swinburne was vastly amused, and rallied
his friend gleefully for being what he described as
“the ogre of suckling bardlings,” but Watts-Dunton
was visibly distressed, and took it so much to heart
that I had cause to regret my indiscretion. He
brooded over it and rumbled menacingly over it,
recurring to the matter again and again, until lunch
was over, vowing that it mattered nothing to him
what this or that “writing fellow” thought of him as
a fellow writer, but that to be credited with cruelty,
and with willingness to give pain, to the younger
generation, with whom he was so entirely in sympathy,
was monstrous, was unthinkable, and was
cause for cursing the day he had ever consented to
review for the <cite>Athenæum</cite>.</p>

<p>Here are some extracts from another letter in
which he reverts to the matter, and also incidentally
gives an interesting peep of Swinburne and himself
on holiday:</p>

<p>“The crowning mistake of my life, a life that has
been full of mistakes, I fear, was in drifting into the
position of literary reviewer to a journal, and not
drifting out for a quarter of a century. I not only
squandered my efforts, but made unconsciously a
thousand enemies in the literary world whom I can
never hope now to appease until death comes to my
aid. Swinburne sends you his kind regards. He
and I are here staying at one of the lovely places
in the Isle of Wight, belonging to his aunt, Lady
Mary Gordon. It is a fairy place. Her late husband’s
father took one of the most romantic spots
of the Undercliff and turned the shelves of debris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
into the loveliest Italian garden reaching down to
the sea. It is so shut in from the land that it can be
seen only from the sea. It puts, as I always say,
Edgar Poe’s <cite>Domain of Arnheim</cite> into the shade. I
know of nothing in the world so lovely. I have been
writing a few sonnets, but Swinburne does nothing
but bathe.”</p>

<p>This reference to Swinburne idling reminds me of
another letter I received from Watts-Dunton, in
which he pictures yet another great poet, Tennyson,
hard at work and at eighty-two. The letter has no
bearing on the matter immediately under discussion,
but by way of contrast I venture to include it here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Aldworth, Haslemere, Surrey</span>,<br />
<span class="l2"><i>26th Sept., ’91</i>.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">My best thanks for your most kind letter
which has been forwarded to me here where I am
staying with Tennyson. When I get home I will
write to suggest a day for us to meet at Putney.
Tennyson, with whom I took a long walk of three
miles this morning, is in marvellous health, every
faculty (at 82) is as bright as it was when his years
were 40. He is busy writing poetry as fine as anything
he has ever written. He read out to me last
night three poems which of themselves would
suffice to make a poet’s fame. Really he is a
miracle. This is a lovely place&mdash;I don’t know how
many miles above the level of the sea&mdash;bracing to
a wonderful degree.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Ever yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Theodore Watts</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
The accepted tradition of Watts-Dunton as what
Swinburne had called the ogre of the <cite>Athenæum</cite>
goaded him, was a bugbear and a purgatory to him
to his very life’s end.</p>

<p>“I see that you mention Mr. William Watson as a
friend of yours,” he wrote to me. “&mdash;&mdash; who was here
the other day, greatly vexed and even distressed me
by telling me that Mr. Watson is under the impression
that I have written disparagingly of his work.
Why, it was I who at a moment, when Rossetti
refused to look at any book sent to him, persuaded
him to read <cite>The Prince’s Quest</cite> years ago, and got
him to write to the author (for though a bad correspondent
myself, I am exemplary in persuading
my friends to be good ones). It was I who wrote to
Fisher Unwin when he sent me <cite>Wordsworth’s Grave</cite>,
urging him to reprint <cite>The Prince’s Quest</cite>.”</p>

<p>Not once but a score of times he spoke to me of
his high admiration of some of Mr. Watson’s
poems, as well as of poems by Stephen Phillips,
John Davidson, Mrs. Clement Shorter, and many
others of the younger poets. His championship of
a certain other writer of verse who shall be nameless,
involved him in a controversy which was like
to end in a personal severance between himself and
his correspondent.</p>

<p>“What you said about &mdash;&mdash; is specially amusing,”
he wrote, “because on the very morning after you
were here I got a letter from an acquaintance abusing
me to such a degree that I am by no means sure it
will not end in a personal severance. And all because
I was backing up one whom he describes as the most
impudent self-advertising man that has ever claimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
to be a poet. According to the irate one, he has
nobbled not only New Grub Street complete, but
also sub-edits the &mdash;&mdash; and writes himself up there,
and devotes his time to paragraphing himself in
the &mdash;&mdash;! I pointed out in my answer that to me,
who do not read these organs, save slightly, that the
question of physical power and time presented
itself and made me sceptical as to the possibility of
a man who has produced many verses of late, and
good ones to boot, being such a prolific rival of
Mr. Pears and Mr. Colman, and as I said so in rather
a chaffy way, my correspondent has taken umbrage.
But oh, ‘these writing fellows!’ as Wellington used
to call the knights of the ink-horn.”</p>

<p>I suspect that it was what Watts-Dunton calls
his “chaffy way” more than his championship of
the verse-maker which gave offence to his correspondent.
His humour was of the old-fashioned Dickensian
sort, but heavier of foot, more cumbrous of
movement, occasionally somewhat grim, and rumbling,
like distant thunder, over a drollery. It is
possible that what he meant for playful raillery at
his correspondent’s exasperation that a verse-maker
should enter into a competition with Mr.
Colman and Mr. Pears, by advertising his wares in
the same way that they advertise mustard or soap,
was taken as a seriously meant reproof. Be that as
it may, for I did not hear the sequel of the controversy,
Watts-Dunton, so far from being the ogre
he was painted, was, on the contrary, something of
a fairy godmother to many a young and struggling
poet of parts. But even so he found that poets
not of the first rank are hard to please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Acknowledging the receipt of a presentation copy
of verses from an acquaintance of his and mine, I
chanced to inquire whether Theodore Watts was
likely to review the book in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>. “God
forbid!” wrote the poet in reply. “If so, he would
simply make my unfortunate book the peg upon
which to hang a wonderful literary robe of spun silk
and fine gold. He would begin&mdash;omitting all mention
of me or my book&mdash;with some generalisation,
some great first principle, whether of life, literature,
science or art, no one, other than himself or the God
who made him, could ever be sure beforehand. In
his hands it would be absorbingly fresh, learned,
illuminative and fascinating. Thence he would
launch out into an essay, incomparable in knowledge
and in scholarship, that would deal with everything
in heaven or on earth, in this world or the next,
other than my unhappy little book. He would, in
fact, open up so many worlds of wonder and romance,
in which to lose himself, that I should think myself
fortunate if, at the end of his review, I found my
name as much as mentioned, and should count myself
favoured were there as much as one whole line
in the whole four page essay in the <cite>Athenæum</cite> about
my little book.”</p>

<p>I am free to admit that there is much that is true
in the analysis of Watts-Dunton’s method of reviewing,
and that he was aware of this himself will
be seen by my next quotation. It so happened that
he did, much pressed though he was at the time,
put his own work aside, and review the book in
question in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>. He did so from the
single desire to forward the interests of a young poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Here is part of a letter which he afterwards sent
to me upon the subject. The review itself I did not
see, but that it was upon the lines anticipated and
failed to satisfy the poet in question is very
clear.</p>

<p>“My method of reviewing, though it is well understood
by the more famous men, does not seem to
please and to satisfy the less distinguished ones;
and this makes me really timid about reviewing any
of them. But I believe, indeed I am sure, that my
methods of using a book as an illustration of some
first principle in criticism gives it more importance,
attracts to it more attention than any more businesslike
review article of the ordinary kind would, because
my speciality is known to be that of dealing
with first principles.</p>

<p>“I am just off again to Dursley in Gloucestershire
to visit, with Swinburne, his mother and sister, who
are staying there.</p>

<p>“I think I have satisfied myself that Shakespeare’s
evident familiarity with Gloucestershire is owing
to his having stayed at Dursley with one of the
Shakespeares who was living there during his
lifetime. The Gloucestershire names of people
mentioned by him are still largely represented at
Dursley and the neighbourhood, and the description
of the outlook toward Berkeley is amazingly
accurate.”</p>

<p>But Watts-Dunton had cause to regret his kindly
action in departing from his almost invariable
rule to review only poets of the first standing, nor
was he allowed, free from irritating distractions,
peacefully to pursue his researches into Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
associations with Gloucestershire. The poet wrote
again&mdash;this time to complain that the review was not
sufficiently eulogistic. Watts-Dunton sent me the
letter with the following comment:</p>

<p>“What the devil would these men have? I
suppose we are all to fall at their feet as soon as
they have written a few good verses and discuss them
as we discuss Sophocles, Æschylus, and Sappho.
Does this not corroborate what Swinburne was
saying to you the other day about the modesty of
the first-rate poet and the something else of the
others?”</p>

<p>After Watts-Dunton’s return from Gloucester,
I was lunching with Swinburne and himself at The
Pines, and the aggrieved poet called in person while
I was there. Swinburne, who hated to make a new
acquaintance, and not only resolutely refused himself
to every one, but, when Watts-Dunton had visitors
with whom he was unacquainted, frequently
betook himself to his own sanctum upstairs
until they were gone, happened that morning to
be in an impish mood. At any other time he would
have stormed at the bare suggestion of admitting the
man to the house. But on this particular morning
he took a Puck-like delight in the hornets’ nest
which Watts-Dunton had brought about his ears
by what Swinburne held to be an undeserved honour
and kindness to an undeserving and ungrateful
scribbler, and he wished, or pretended to wish, that
the poet be admitted. He vowed, and before
heaven, that a windy encounter between the “grave
and great-browed critic of the <cite>Athenæum</cite>” and the
“browsing and long-eared bardling with a grievance”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
would be as droll as a comedy scene from <cite>A Midsummer
Night’s Dream</cite>.</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton&mdash;outwardly smiling indulgently
at his friend’s whimsical and freakish mood, but
inwardly by no means regarding the matter in the
light of a jest, and not a little chafed and sore&mdash;declined
to see the caller then or at any other time.</p>

<p>“Reviewing poets other than those of the first
rank,” he protested, “is the most thankless task
on God’s earth. The smaller the man is intellectually,
the harder, the more impossible he is to please,
and the greedier he is of unstinted adulation. Strain
your critical sense and your generosity to the point
of comparing him to Marlowe or Marvell, and he will
give you to understand that his work has more of
the manner of Shelley. Compare him to Shelley,
and the odds are he will grumble that it wasn’t
Shakespeare, and I’m not sure that some of them
would rest contented with that. I have tried to do a
kindness, and I have succeeded only in making an
enemy. That fellow is implacable. He will pursue
me with hatred to the end of my life.”</p>

<p>Yet in this particular instance, as in many others,
Watts-Dunton’s error had been only on the side
of excessive generosity, for which Swinburne had
taken him to task. Swinburne himself, it is idle
to say, was a Jupiter in his judgments. He was
ready to vacate his own throne and hail one poet
as a god, or utterly to overwhelm another with a
hurled avalanche of scorn. But at least he reserved
his laudation and his worship, or else his “volcanic
wrath” and thunderbolts, for his masters and his
peers. He delivered judgment uninfluenced by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
personal element or by kindly sentiment and easy
good nature. Watts-Dunton’s good-hearted efforts
to find something to praise in the work even of little
men occasionally annoyed Swinburne, and drew
the fire of his withering criticism upon the target of
their work. It was the one and only thing upon
which I knew them to differ, and in this connection
I should like to add a word upon the relationship
which existed between these two brothers in
friendship and in song. Ideal as was that relationship,
it had this drawback&mdash;that it tended to
“standardize,” if I may so phrase it, their prejudices
upon purely personal, as apart from critical
or intellectual issues.</p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks in <cite>The Professor
at the Breakfast Table</cite> of “that slight inclination
of two persons with a strong affinity towards each
other, throwing them a little out of plumb when they
sit side by side together.”</p>

<p>This saying has a mental as well as a physical
application. It is surprising, as I have elsewhere
said, how entirely Watts-Dunton’s individuality
remained uninfluenced by his close association with
two men of such strongly-marked and extraordinary
individuality as Rossetti and Swinburne. One
reservation must, however, be made. On certain
personal matters the plumb of Watts-Dunton’s
judgment was apt slightly to be deflected out of
line by Swinburne’s denunciation. If Swinburne
thundered an anathema against some one who had
provoked his wrath, Watts-Dunton, even if putting
in a characteristically indulgent word for the
offender, was inclined&mdash;if unconsciously and against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
his better judgment&mdash;to view the matter in the
same light.</p>

<p>Similarly, if Watts-Dunton had some small cause
of complaint&mdash;it might even be a fancied cause of
complaint&mdash;and Swinburne heard of it, the latter’s
attachment to his friend caused him so to trumpet
his anger as to magnify the matter to undue
importance in Watts-Dunton’s eyes as well as in his
own.</p>

<p>In this way and in this way only the association
between Watts-Dunton and Swinburne was to the
advantage of neither, as the mind of the one reacted
sometimes upon the mind of the other to
produce prejudice and to impair judgment. I
have no thought or intention of belittling either
in saying this. It is no service to the memory of a
friend to picture him as a superman and superior
to all human weakness. But if Watts-Dunton was
not without his prejudices and literary dislike, he
was as a critic the soul of honour, and would not
write a line in review of the work of the man or
woman concerning whom he had justly or unjustly
already formed an unfavourable opinion. As a
reviewer he set a standard which we should do well
to maintain. He was no Puritan. To him everything
in life was spiritually symbolic, and nothing
was of itself common or unclean. The article
in which he dealt with Sterne’s indecencies shirks
nothing that needed to be said upon the subject,
but says it in such a way as to recall Le Gallienne’s
happy definition of purity&mdash;as the power to
touch pitch while remaining undefiled&mdash;for in all
Watts-Dunton’s spoken no less than in his written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
word, there was no single passage, no single line,
which one could on that score regret. In his poems
the red flambeau of passion and the white taper
of purity burn side by side on one altar. His innate
love of purity, his uncompromising attitude towards
everything suggestive or unclean, were among his
most marked characteristics as writer and as man.
It is well for literature that one of the greatest
critics of our day should have thus jealously guarded
the honour of the mistress whom he served. As
a poet, he was of the company of those who, in his
own words:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have for muse a maiden free from scar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows how beauty dies at touch of sin.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">He kept unsullied the white shield of English
Literature, and his influence for good is none the less
lasting and real because it can never be estimated.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_84" class="vspace">WHY THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON<br />
PUBLISHED ONLY TWO BOOKS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">With</span> the exception of a few articles and
poems reprinted in brochure form from
encyclopædias and periodicals, Watts-Dunton
in his lifetime published two books only&mdash;<cite>Aylwin</cite>
and <cite>The Coming of Love</cite>. A successor to the
former is in existence, and will shortly be issued by
Mr. John Lane. Were Watts-Dunton still alive, the
book would, I am convinced, even now be in
manuscript. Part definitely with a book, that it
might go to press, he would not, so long as a chance
remained of holding on to it, to dovetail in a poem
or a prose passage, perhaps from something penned
many years ago, or to rewrite, amend, or omit whole
chapters. I have seen proofs of his as bewildering
in the matter of what printers call “pulling copy
about” as a jigsaw puzzle. <cite>Aylwin</cite> itself represents
no one period of the author’s lifetime, but all his
literary life, up to the actual final passing for press.</p>

<p>This is true also of the new book <cite>Carniola</cite>, commenced,
under the title of <cite>Balmoral</cite>, as far back as
the days before Watts-Dunton left St. Ives to come
to London, and, upon it, he was more or less at
work up to the last. It takes its new title from the
hero, who, the son of an English father and an
Hungarian mother, was christened Carniola, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
the Hungarian town of that name where he was
born.</p>

<p>The story I have not read in its entirety, but I
know that Watts-Dunton considered the love
interest stronger even than in <cite>Aylwin</cite>, and his
pictures of life more varied and painted in upon a
wider canvas.</p>

<p>The portions I have seen strike me&mdash;remembering,
as has already been said, how little Watts-Dunton’s
personality and literary manner were influenced by
any of the great contemporaries with whom he was
intimately associated&mdash;as more Borrovian than anything
else he has written.</p>

<p>This applies particularly to the conversations.
Unlike some later novelists, who aim at crispness in
conversational passages, by so “editing” what is
said as to “cut” the inevitable and necessary
commonplaces of conversation, and record only
what is witty, epigrammatic and to the point,
Watts-Dunton, like Borrow, sets all down exhaustively&mdash;the
“give and take” of small talk,
with all the “I saids” and “he saids” in full, and
with illuminating little descriptions of the gestures
and feelings of the speaker.</p>

<p>This gives a reality and naturalness to the dialogue,
which we miss, for all their smartness, crispness,
and epigram, in the work of certain more modern
novelists, reading whom, one is inclined to wonder
whether two ordinary mortals ever did, in real life,
rattle off, impromptu, quite so many brilliant
repartees, and clever epigrams, in so short a time.</p>

<p>Very Borrovian too are the open-air and nature-loving
passages of <cite>Carniola</cite>, and the gypsy scenes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
which there are many. Readers of <cite>Aylwin</cite> will be
interested to meet with a gypsy girl, Klari, drawn
from real life, who, in Watts-Dunton’s opinion, is
more beautiful and more attractive than Sinfi
Lovell of <cite>Aylwin</cite> and <cite>The Coming of Love</cite>. Those
who had any personal knowledge, or have read the
books, of one of the most fascinating and romantic
figures and fine scholars of his time, the late Francis
Hinde Groome, will find him drawn&mdash;Watts-Dunton
believed faithfully&mdash;in the character of Stormont.</p>

<p>Another striking piece of characterisation is the
wheelwright, Martin, whose “religiosity”&mdash;not to
be confounded with the sincerity and unselfishness
of a truly religious man or woman&mdash;is narrow, self-seeking,
cruel, and Calvinistic.</p>

<p>“Make a success&mdash;and run away from it!” said
a great and experienced publisher to me one day.
Watts-Dunton made a great success with <cite>Aylwin</cite>.
It will be interesting to see whether by following
<cite>Aylwin</cite> with a second novel of Bohemian life&mdash;the
character on which he has lavished most care is that
of an Hungarian gypsy, a Punch and Judy showman,
and the scene is laid partly in England and partly
in Hungary&mdash;Watts-Dunton will prove the publisher
to be, in this case at least, wrong.</p>

<p>The rest of Watts-Dunton’s contributions to
literature must be sought for in back numbers
of the reviews, magazines and critical journals,
and as Introductory Studies and Essays prefixed
to reprints. That a man of his enormous and
many-sided knowledge should apply himself to
the craft of letters practically from early manhood
to extreme old age, and leave only two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
published volumes behind him, establishes surely
a record in these days of over-publication. One
cannot wonder that his readers and admirers should
ask that he be more adequately represented on
their bookshelves by the collection, into permanent
volume form, of his many incomparable articles and
essays. Until that is done, I may perhaps be
permitted to point out that in a sense such a work
already exists. The literary harvest of Watts-Dunton’s
life has been reaped, winnowed, and garnered
into one volume which, indeed, is not only a
volume but a Watts-Dunton library in itself.</p>

<p>I refer of course to Mr. James Douglas’s <cite>Theodore
Watts-Dunton, Poet, Novelist and Critic</cite>, a work
which with all its faults, and it has many, is of
remarkable interest. I do not say this because Mr.
Douglas has told us everything that can be told,
and much that it was unnecessary to tell about
the life and work, the memorable friendships and
the literary methods of the author of <cite>Aylwin</cite>, but
because Mr. Douglas has with infinite care and pains
harvested, sifted, winnowed, and gleaned the whole
field of Watts-Dunton’s literary labours. The
portion of the book in which the fine gold of his
writings upon Wonder as the primal Element in all
religion; upon the first awakenings in the soul
of man of a sense of Wonder, or perhaps I should
say upon the awakening, the birth, of a soul in man
by means of Wonder; the noble exposition of the
Psalms, the Prayer Book, and of the Bible in its
relation to the soul and to the Universe; the
analysis of Humour; the portions that deal with
Nature and Nature-Worship; with the methods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and Art of great writers in poetry and prose, and
with First Principles generally&mdash;these in themselves
and by themselves make Mr. Douglas’s book
unique.</p>

<p>I am not sure, indeed, that it will not eventually
do more for Watts-Dunton’s reputation as a thinker
than the publication of a whole library of his
collected writings. For in his contributions to the
periodical Press, Watts-Dunton is apt sometimes
to be diffuse. He becomes befogged, as it were, with
the multitudinousness of his own learning. His
“cogitations”&mdash;the word is more applicable to
most of his work than “essays”&mdash;were so prodigious,
branched out into such innumerable but always fascinating
and pregnant side issues, as to bewilder the
ordinary reader. In Mr. Douglas’s book with such
judgment are the passages selected, that we get the
best of Watts-Dunton in a comparatively small
compass, clarified, condensed, and presented with
cameo clearness. It contains, I admit, not a little
with which I would willingly away. I tire sometimes
of gypsies and gorgios and Sinfi Lovell, as I tire
of the recurrence of the double-syllabled feminine
rhyming of “glory” and “story,” “hoary” and
“promontory,” in some of the sonnets.</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas quotes Rossetti as affirming of
Watts-Dunton that he was the one man of his
time who with immense literary equipment was
without literary ambition. This may be true of the
Theodore Watts of Rossetti’s time. It is not
altogether true of the Watts-Dunton whom I knew
during the last quarter of a century.</p>

<p>The extraordinary success of <cite>Aylwin</cite>, published,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
be it remembered&mdash;though some of us had been
privileged to see it long before&mdash;in 1898, when the
author was 66, bewildered and staggered Watts-Dunton,
but the literary ambitions which that
success aroused came too late in life to be realised.
Though a prodigious and untiring worker, he was
unsystematic and a dreamer. The books that he
intended to write would have outnumbered the
unwritten volumes of Robert Louis Stevenson. Had
Stevenson lived longer, his dream-books would one
day have materialised into manuscript and finally
into paper and print. He was one of those whom
Jean Paul Richter had in mind when he said:
“There shall come a time when man shall awaken
from his lofty dreams and find&mdash;his dreams still
there, and that nothing has gone save his sleep.”
Stevenson worked by impulse. His talk and his
letters&mdash;like too plenteously-charged goblets, which
brim over and run to waste&mdash;were full of stories he
was set upon writing, but from which on the morrow
he turned aside to follow some literary Lorelei
whose lurings more accorded with the mood of the
moment.</p>

<p>“I shall have another portfolio paper so soon
as I am done with this story that has played me
out,” he wrote to Sir Sidney Colvin in January, 1875.
“The story is to be called <cite>When the Devil was Well</cite>.
Scene, Italy, Renaissance; colour, purely imaginary
of course, my own unregenerate idea of what
Italy then was. O, when shall I find the story of
my dreams, that shall never halt nor wander one
step aside, but go ever before its face and ever swifter
and louder until the pit receives its roaring?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
But Stevenson worked of set purpose, and, for the
most part, sooner or later in another mood, went
rainbow-chasing again, hoping to find&mdash;like the
pot of gold which children believe lies hidden where
the rainbow ends&mdash;his broken fragments of a dream
that he might recover and weave them into story
form.</p>

<p>Sometimes he succeeded; sometimes he found
that the vision had wholly faded, or that the mood
to interpret it had gone, and so more often he
failed. But Watts-Dunton was content only to
dream and, alas, to procrastinate, at least in the
matter of screwing himself up to the preparation
of a book. In that respect he was the despair even
of his dearest friends.</p>

<p>Francis Hinde Groome wrote to me as far back as
January, 1896:</p>

<p>“Watts, I hope, has <em>not</em> definitely abandoned the
idea of a Life of Rossetti, or he might, he suggests,
weave his reminiscences of him into his own reminiscences.
But I doubt. The only way, I believe,
would be for some one regularly day after day to
engage him in talk for a couple of hours and for a
shorthand writer to be present to take it down. If
I had the leisure I would try and incite him thereto
myself.”</p>

<p>I agree with Groome that that was the only way
out of the difficulty. Left to himself, I doubt
whether Watts-Dunton would ever have permitted
even <cite>Aylwin</cite>, ready for publication as it was, to see
the light. Of the influences which were brought to
bear to persuade him ultimately to take the plunge,
and by whom exerted, no less than of the reasons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
why the book was so long withheld, I shall not
here write. Mr. Douglas says nothing of either
matter in his book, and the presumption is that
he was silent by Watts-Dunton’s own wish. This,
however, I may add, that were the reasons for
withholding the book so long fully known, they
would afford yet another striking proof of the
chivalrous loyalty of Watts-Dunton’s friendship.
One reason&mdash;it is possible that even Mr. Douglas
is not aware of it, for it dates back to a time when
he did not know Watts-Dunton, and I have reason
to believe that the author of <cite>Aylwin</cite> spoke of it
only at the time, and then only to a few intimates,
nearly all of whom are now dead&mdash;I very much regret
I do not feel free to make known. It would afford
an unexampled instance of Watts-Dunton’s readiness
to sacrifice his own interests and inclinations, in
order to assist a friend&mdash;in this case not a famous,
but a poor and struggling one.</p>

<p>If his unwillingness to see his own name on the
back of a book was a despair to his friends, it must
have been even more so to some half-dozen publishers
who might be mentioned. The enterprising
publisher who went to him with some literary
project, Watts-Dunton “received,” in the words of
the late Mr. Harry Fragson’s amusing song, “most
politely.” At first he hummed and haw’d and
rumpled his hair protesting that he had not the
time at his disposal to warrant him in accepting a
commission to write a book. But if the proposed
book were one that he could write, that he ought
to write, he became sympathetically responsive
and finally glowed, like fanned tinder, touched by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
match, under the kindling of the publisher’s pleading.
“Yes,” he would say. “I cannot deny that I
could write such a book. Such a book, I do not
mind saying in confidence, has long been in my mind,
and in the mind of friends who have repeatedly
urged me to such work.” The fact is that Watts-Dunton
was gratified by the request and did not
disguise his pleasure, for with all his vast learning
and acute intellect there was a singular and childlike
simplicity about him that was very lovable.
Actually accept a commission to write the book in
question he would not, but he was not unwilling to
hear the proposed terms, and in fact seemed so
attracted by, and so interested in, the project that
the pleased publisher would leave, conscious of
having done a good morning’s work, and of having
been the first to propose, and so practically to bespeak,
a book that was already almost as good as
written, already almost as good as published,
already almost as good as an assured success.
Perhaps he chuckled at the thought of the march
he had stolen on his fellow publishers, who would
envy him the inclusion of such a book in his list.
Possibly, even, he turned in somewhere to lunch,
and, as the slang phrase goes, “did himself well”
on the strength of it.</p>

<p>But whatever the publisher’s subsequent doings,
the chances were that Watts-Dunton went back
to his library, to brood over the idea, very likely
to write to some of us whose advice he valued, or
more likely still to telegraph, proposing a meeting to
discuss the project (I had not a few such letters
and telegrams from him myself); perhaps in imagination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
to see the book written and published; but
ultimately and inevitably&mdash;to procrastinate and
in the end to let the proposal lapse. Like the good
intentions with which, according to the proverb,
the road to perdition is paved, Watts-Dunton’s
book-writing intentions, if intentions counted, would
in themselves go far to furnish a fat corner of the
British Museum Library. That he never carried
these intentions into effect is due to other reasons
than procrastination.</p>

<p>It is only fair to him to remember that his life-work,
his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">magnum opus</i>, must be looked for not in
literature but in friendship. Stevenson’s life-work
was his art. “I sleep upon my art for a pillow,” he
wrote to W.&nbsp;E. Henley. “I waken in my art; I
am unready for death because I hate to leave it. I
love my wife, I do not know how much, nor can,
nor shall, unless I lost her; but while I can conceive
of being widowed, I refuse the offering of life without
my art; I <em>am</em> not but in my art; it is me; I
am the body of it merely.”</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton’s life-work, I repeat, was not literature
nor poetry, but friendship. Stevenson sacrificed
himself in nothing for his friends. On the
contrary, he looked to them to sacrifice something
of time and interest and energy on his behalf. Watts-Dunton’s
whole life was one long self-sacrifice&mdash;I
had almost written one fatal self-sacrifice&mdash;of his
own interests, his own fame, in the cause of his
friends. His best books stand upon our shelves in
every part of the English-speaking world, but the
name that appears upon the cover is not that of
Theodore Watts-Dunton, but of Dante Gabriel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. He
wrote no Life of either, but how much of their life
and of their life’s best work we owe to Watts-Dunton
we shall never know. Their death was a cruel blow
to him; but, had he died first, the loss to Rossetti
and to Swinburne would have been terrible and
irreparable. Just as, to Stevenson, life seemed almost
unimaginable without his art, so I find it hard,
almost impossible, to picture Swinburne’s life at
The Pines, failing the sustaining and brotherly
presence of Watts-Dunton. Often, when Watts-Dunton
was ailing, I have come away from there
with a sinking at my heart lest it should be Watts-Dunton
who died first, and I can well believe that,
long ago, a like dread sometimes possessed those
who loved Rossetti. Cheerfully and uncomplainingly,
Watts-Dunton gave his own life and his own
life’s work for them, and his best book is the volume
of his devotion to his friends.</p>

<p>The sum of that devotion will never fully be
known, but it was as much at the service of the unknown,
or those who were only little known among
us, as of the famous. He had his enemies&mdash;“the
hated of New Grub Street” was his playful description
of himself&mdash;and some of them have not hesitated
to hint that he attached himself barnacle-wise or
parasite-wise to greater men than himself for self-seeking
reasons. Borne thither on their backs&mdash;it
was sometimes said&mdash;he was able to sun himself
upon Parnassian heights, otherwise unattainable;
and being in their company, and of their company,
he hoped thus to attract to himself a little of their
reflected glory. The truth is that it was not their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
abilities nor their fame which drew Watts-Dunton
to Rossetti and to Swinburne, but his love of the
men themselves, and his own genius for friendship.
Being the men they were, he would first have been
drawn to them, and thereafter have come to love
them just as wholly and devotedly had they to the
end of their lives remained obscure.</p>

<p>So far from seeking the company or the friendship
of the great, he delighted in making friends in
humble ranks of life.</p>

<p>Anyone who has accompanied Watts-Dunton on
a morning walk will remember a call here at a cottage,
a shop, or it may be an inn where lived some
enthusiastic but poor lover of books, birds or
children, and the glad and friendly greetings that
were exchanged. If, as occasionally happened,
some great person&mdash;great in a social sense, I mean&mdash;happened
to be a caller at The Pines, when
perhaps a struggling young author, painter, or
musician, in whom Watts-Dunton was interested
or was trying to help, happened to be there, one
might be sure that, of the two, it would not be the
great man who would be accorded the warmer greeting
by Watts-Dunton and&mdash;after his marriage&mdash;by
his gracious, beautiful and accomplished young wife.
What he once said of Tennyson is equally true of
Watts-Dunton himself. “When I first knew
Tennyson,” he said, “I was, if possible, a more
obscure literary man than I now am, and he treated
me with exactly the same manly respect that he
treated the most illustrious people.” Watts-Dunton
who, in his poems and in his conversation, could
condense into a sentence what many of us could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
as felicitously convey in a page, puts the whole
matter into two words, “manly respect.” Unless
he had good cause to do otherwise, he, no less than
Tennyson, was prepared to treat others with
“manly respect,” irrespective of fame, riches, or
rank. That is the attitude neither entirely of the
aristocrat nor of the democrat, but of the gentleman
to whom what we call “snobbishness” is impossible.</p>

<p>One more reason why Watts-Dunton’s contribution
to “Letters” in the publishers’ lists runs to no
greater extent than two volumes, is that so many
of his contributions to “Letters” took the form of
epistles to his friends. The writing of original,
characteristic and charming letters&mdash;brilliant by
reason of vivid descriptive passages, valuable because
used as a means of expressing criticism or conveying
knowledge&mdash;is an art now so little practised as
likely soon to be lost.</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton’s letter writing was possibly the
outcome of his habit of procrastination. To put
off the settling down in dead earnest to some work
which he felt ought to be done, but at which he
“shied,” he would suddenly remember a letter
which he thought should be penned. “I must write
So-and-so a line first,” he would say, which line, when
it came to be written, proved to be an essay in
miniature, in which he had&mdash;carelessly, and free
from the irking consciousness that he was writing
for publication and so must mind his words&mdash;thrown
off some of his weightiest and wisest thoughts. He
protested throughout his life that he was a wickedly
bad correspondent. None the less he wrote so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
many charming and characteristic letters that, could
they&mdash;and why not?&mdash;be collected, they would add
yet another to the other reputations he attained.</p>

<p>Swinburne, in recent years at least, did not share
his friend’s predilection for letter writing. The
author of <cite>Atalanta in Calydon</cite> once said to me, almost
bitterly, that had he in early and middle life refrained
from writing and from answering unnecessary
letters&mdash;unnecessary in the sense that there was no
direct call or claim upon him to write or to answer
them&mdash;there would be at least twelve more volumes
by him, and of his best, in the publishers’ lists.
One letter which arrived when I was a guest at The
Pines led Swinburne to expound his theory of
letter answering. It was from a young woman personally
unknown to him, and began by saying that
a great kindness he had once done to her father
emboldened her to ask a favour to herself&mdash;what it
was I now forget, but it necessitated a somewhat
lengthy reply.</p>

<p>“The fact that I have been at some pains to serve
the father, so far from excusing a further claim by
the daughter, is the very reason why, by any
decent member of that family, I should not again be
assailed,” Swinburne expostulated.</p>

<p>“She says,” he went on, “that she trusts I won’t
think she is asking too much, in hoping that I will
answer her letter&mdash;a letter which does not interest
me, nor concern me in the least. She could have got
the information, for which she asks, elsewhere with
very little trouble to herself and none to me. The
exasperating thing about such letters,” he continued,
getting more and more angry, “is this. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
feel that the letter is an unwarrantable intrusion.
Out of consideration to her father I can’t very well
say so, as one does not wish to seem churlish. But,
in any sense, to answer her letter, necessitates
writing at length, thus wasting much precious time,
to say nothing of the chance of being dragged into
further correspondence. It is one’s impotency to
make such folk see things reasonably which irritates.
I have to suppress that irritation, and that results
in further irritation. I am irritated with myself for
being irritated, for not taking things philosophically
as Watts-Dunton does, as well as irritated with her,
and the result is the spoiling of a morning’s work.
She will say perhaps, and you may even say, ‘It is
only one letter you are asked to write.’ Quite so.
Not much, perhaps, to make a fuss about. But”
(he pounded the table with clenched fist angrily)
“multiply that one person by the many who so
write, and the net total works out to an appalling
waste of time.”</p>

<p>My reply was to remind him of N.&nbsp;P. Willis’s protest
that to ask a busy author to write an unnecessary
letter was like asking a postman to go for a ten
miles’ walk&mdash;to which I added, “when he has
taken his boots off.” Swinburne had never heard
the saying, and, with characteristic veering of the
weather-vane of his mood, forgot alike his letter-writing
lady and his own irritation, in his delight
at a fellow sufferer’s happy hit.</p>

<p>“Capital!” he exclaimed, rubbing his hands
together gleefully. “Capital! The worm has
turned, and shows that, worm as he is, he is not
without a sting in his tail!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
In his later years Swinburne wrote few letters
except to a relative, a very intimate friend, or upon
some pressing business. The uninvited correspondent
he rarely answered at all. For every letter that
Swinburne received, Watts-Dunton probably received
six, and sooner or later he answered all. The
amount of time that went in letters, which in no way
concerned his own work, or his own interests, and
were penned only out of kindness of heart, was
appalling. Had he refrained from writing letters
intended to hearten or to help some friend or some
young writer, or to soften a disappointment, the
books that are lost to us&mdash;a Life of Rossetti, for instance&mdash;might
well be to the good. If a book by
a friend happened to be badly slated in a critical
journal&mdash;and no calamity to a friend is borne with
more resignation and even cheerfulness by some of
us who “write” than a bad review of a friend’s
book&mdash;Watts-Dunton, if he chanced to see the
slating, would put work aside, and sit down then and
there to indite to that friend a letter which helped
and heartened him or her much more than the slating
had depressed. I have myself had letters from
fellow authors who told me they were moved to
express sympathy or indignation about this or that
bad review of one of my little books&mdash;the only effect
of their letter being to rub salt into the wound, and
to make one feel how widely one’s literary nakedness
or even literary sinning had been proclaimed
in the market place. Watts-Dunton’s letters not
only made one feel that the review in question
mattered nothing, but he would at the same time
find something to say about the merits of the work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
under review, which not only took the gall out of the
unfriendly critic’s ink, but had the effect of setting
one newly at work, cheered, relieved, and nerved to
fresh effort.</p>

<p>I do not quote here any of these letters, as they
are concerned only with my own small writings, and
so would be of no interest to the reader. Instead, let
me quote one I received from him on another subject.
A sister of mine sent me a sonnet in memory of a
dead poet, a friend of Watts-Dunton’s and mine, and,
having occasion to write to him on another matter,
I enclosed it without comment. Almost by return
of post came the following note, in which he was at
the pains, unasked, to give a young writer the
benefit of his weighty criticism and encouragement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My thanks for sending me your sister’s lovely
sonnet. I had no idea that she was a genuine poet.
It is only in the seventh line where I see an opening
for improvement.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To <i>a</i> great/darkness and/in a/great light.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It is an error to suppose that when the old
scansion by quantity gave place to scansion by
accent, the quantitative demands upon a verse
became abrogated. A great deal of attention to
quantity is apparent in every first-rate <span class="locked">line&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sleepless soul that perished in its prime,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">where by making the accent and the quantity meet
(and quantity, I need not remind you, is a matter
of consonants quite as much as of vowels) all the
strength that can be got into an iambic English
verse is fixed there. Although, of course, it would
make a passage monotonous if in every instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
quantity and accent were made to meet, those who
aim at the best versification give great attention
to it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one instance only out of many of his
interest in a young writer who was then personally
unknown to him; but in turning over for the
purpose of this article those letters of his,
which I have preserved, I have found so many
similar reminders of his great-heartedness that I am
moved once again to apply to Theodore Watts-Dunton
the words in which many years ago I dedicated
a book to him. They are from James Payn’s
<cite>Literary Recollections</cite>. “My experience of men of
letters is that for kindness of heart they have no
equal. I contrast their behaviour to the young and
struggling, with the harshness of the Lawyer, the
hardness of the Man of Business, the contempt of
the Man of the World, and am proud to belong to
their calling.”</p>

<span class="smaller">AS AN AMATEUR IN AUTHORSHIP AND<br />
AS A GOOD FELLOW<br /><br />

<span class="smaller">TWO SIDES OF HIS MANY-SIDEDNESS</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> one thing of all others upon which
Watts-Dunton set store was good-fellowship,
which he counted as of greater worth
even than genius. If ever he went critically astray,
if ever intellectually he overrated his man, it was
because he allowed his heart to outride his head.
Once convince him that this or that young writer
was a good fellow, and, born critic though he was,
even criticism went by the board in Watts-Dunton’s
intellectual estimate. If I illustrate this by a
personal experience it is not to speak of myself,
but because, though I have personal knowledge
of many similar instances, in this instance I have
the “documents” in the case before me. It concerns
the circumstances by which I first came to know
Watts-Dunton.</p>

<p>In the New Year of 1885 there appeared the first
number of a weekly (afterwards a monthly) magazine
with the somewhat infelicitous if not feeble title
of <cite>Home Chimes</cite>. It was edited and owned by
F.&nbsp;W. Robinson, then a popular novelist. To the
first number Swinburne and Theodore Watts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
contributed poems, and in that now dead and forgotten
venture the early work of many men and
women who thereafter became famous is to be
found. For instance, Jerome K. Jerome’s <cite>Idle
Thoughts of an Idle Fellow</cite> as well as his <cite>Three
Men in a Boat</cite> first saw the light there. There,
much of Sir James Barrie’s early work appeared,
for I once heard the author of <cite>A Window in Thrums</cite>
say, though I do not suppose he meant to be taken
too seriously, that there was a time when to him
“London” meant the place where <cite>Home Chimes</cite>
was published. There, early work by Eden Phillpotts,
Israel Zangwill, G.&nbsp;B. Burgin, and a host of
others who have since “come into their own”
was printed, and there, I may say incidentally, part
of my own first little book appeared.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Robinson once said to me reminiscently,
“it is true that Jerome, Barrie, Phillpotts, Zangwill,
Burgin and yourself all more or less ‘came out’
in <cite>Home Chimes</cite>, but I have my doubts sometimes
whether the whole of you ever raised the sale of the
magazine by so much as a number.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” I replied, “my own opinion
is that, between us, we killed it.”</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Robinson lost heavily upon
<cite>Home Chimes</cite> and was hit even harder by the death
of the “three-decker”&mdash;I mean by the ousting of
novels in three volumes at thirty shillings in favour
of novels in one volume at six shillings. The change,
indeed, caused such a drop in his income that he
decided to look about him for another means of
livelihood outside literature, and when, soon after,
an Inspectorship of H.M. Prisons became vacant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
he decided to apply for the appointment. For
this he had special qualifications, as he had for years
closely and critically studied our Prison System
and had, in fact, written and published much upon
the subject. Knowing how eager he was, for pecuniary
reasons, to secure the appointment, and being
anxious to do what I could to assist his candidature
(I plead guilty to “log-rolling” in this most justifiable
instance), I asked the late Mr. Passmore
Edwards, proprietor and editor of the <cite>Echo</cite>, the
only halfpenny evening paper in those days, to
let me write a sketch of Robinson in the “Echo
Portrait Gallery” to which I was a contributor. In
this sketch&mdash;it was signed “C.&nbsp;K.” merely&mdash;I
touched, purposely, upon Robinson’s close study
and special knowledge of the workings and defects
of our Prison System. My article was seen by
Theodore Watts, who wrote Robinson a letter which
the latter sent on to me. It was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Robinson</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I have been delighted by a notice of you in
the <cite>Echo</cite>, which I am told is by Coulson Kernahan.
That must be a charming fellow who wrote it. Why
don’t you collect your loyal supporters around you
(there are only two of us, Kernahan and Watts)
over a little dinner at your Club?</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Yours ever,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Theodore Watts</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Robinson, if you had not been the most modest
and delicate-minded man in contemporary literature,
you would have trebled your fame and trebled your
income. That is what C.&nbsp;K. says of you, but I have
said it for a quarter of a century.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
This was the beginning of my long friendship
with Watts-Dunton, and I enter thus fully into
a merely trivial and personal matter for the reason
that the letter I have quoted is very characteristic
of the writer. “Good fellowship” was, I repeat,
the first article in Watts-Dunton’s creed. His very
religion was based upon it. He once said to me
that were it not that some good men and women
would see irreverence where he meant none, and of
which he was by temperament and by his very
sense of wonder incapable, he should like to write
an article “The Good-fellowship of God,” taking
as his text the lines of Omar Khayyám, in which the
old tent-maker speaks of those who picture a
“surly” God:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“And daub His Visage with the Smoke of Hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They talk of some strict testing of us&mdash;Pish!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s a Good Fellow and ’twill all be well.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“To word it thus may sound profanely to some
ears,” commented Watts-Dunton, “but old Khayyám
was only trying to express in his pagan way&mdash;though
I suspect there is as much of FitzGerald as of Omar
in the rendering&mdash;his belief in the loving Fatherhood
of God which is held by every Christian. In fact
‘good-fellowship’ stands to Shakespeare’s ‘cakes-and-ale’-loving,
and jolly fraternity, for the ‘Human
Brotherhood’ of which the stricter church and
chapel going folk speak, and I suspect that there
is sometimes less acrimony and a broader human
outlook over cakes and ale in an inn than there is
over urn-stewed tea, bread and butter and buns
in some of the Church or Chapel Tea-meetings that
went on when I was a boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
My article about Robinson was merely an attempt
to set out his qualifications for the post of Inspector
of Prisons. Those qualifications were many and
my space was limited. Hence the article was as
dull and stodgy a recital of facts as ever was written.
There was as much in it from which to infer that the
writer was a “charming fellow” as there is in a
rice pudding by which to prove that the cook can
sing divinely. But Robinson was a “good fellow.”
My article, among other things, made that at least
clear. According to the gospel of good-fellowship
as held by Watts-Dunton, a good fellow could be
appreciated only by a good fellow, just as he once
wrote to me, “My theory always is that a winsome
style in prose comes from a man whose heart is
good.” I had shown appreciation of his friend,
and, partisan and hero of friendship that he was,
he was willing to take the rest on trust. Rightly
to appreciate his friend was to win Watts-Dunton’s
heart at the start.</p>

<p>One sometimes hears or sees it stated that Watts-Dunton
was indifferent alike to literary fame and to
criticism, adverse or favourable. No one who knew
him other than very slightly could think thus.
Watts-Dunton was, in scriptural phrase, “a man in
whom was no guile.” He was transparently
ingenuous of thought and purpose and did not
attempt to conceal his gratification at the success
of <cite>Aylwin</cite> or the pleasure which a discriminating
and sympathetic appreciation afforded him. This
only added to the respect and affection of his friends.
It would have wounded us to think that the man
we bore intellectually in such profound reverence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
personally in such deep affection, could play the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poseur</i> and affect to despise the deserved success
and recognition which his work had won. W.&nbsp;E.
Henley is said to have thanked God that he had
“never suffered the indignity of a popular success.”
Henley deserved success, popular or otherwise, if
ever writer did, for he never stooped to do less than
his best, nor sought to achieve by shoddy means
the success which thus attained is indeed to be
despised. But a success deservedly won, even if a
so-called popular success, every writer in his heart
desires. To pretend otherwise is mere insincerity.
It is not “playing the game,” for even the pursuit
of Letters is none the worse for a touch of the
English sporting spirit. It is indeed the chief
reproach of those of us who follow the craft of
Letters that we are “artists” rather than sportsmen.
Englishmen fight the better and write the better
for seeing alike in writing and in fighting something
of a “game.”<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Literature is a race in which
every competitor hopes, and rightly, to come in
first. If he be fairly beaten on his merits, he will
admit and ungrudgingly, if a sportsman as well
as a writer, that the better man has won. This
does not mean he is content tamely to sit down
under defeat. It means, on the contrary, harder
work and severer training, so that on other occasions,
by redoubling his exertions, he himself may be the
man who wins on his merits. And if he fail again and
yet again, instead of sneering at the prize as worthless,
he will, if he ever heard it, recall the story of the
two artists. A very young painter, who afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
became great, stood in his obscure and struggling
days, when no one had heard his name or would
look at his pictures, before the greatest canvas of
the greatest painter of the time. The grandeur of
the work, alike in conception and in execution,
staggered him. Possibly there was despair at his
heart as he asked himself how could he, too poor
for proper opportunity of study, too poor even to
afford a model, or to buy oils, ever hope to emulate
such a masterpiece as this. But at least there was
at his heart no meanness, no envy, no disposition
to belittle or to grudge the other his high place.
Throwing back his head, with flashing eyes and a
throb in his voice he exclaimed proudly, radiantly,
“And I, too, am an artist!”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> This was penned before the war.</p></div>

<p>But when Henley, who strained and strained
splendidly to carry off the first prize&mdash;and missed&mdash;belittles
its value, and would have us to believe
that he is better pleased to carry off “the last
event”&mdash;the “Consolation Prize”&mdash;of “never having
suffered the indignity of a popular success,” we
distrust his sportsmanship and his sincerity. Watts-Dunton
never posed after that manner. He was
glad of his success and proud of it. It was because
success, instead of increasing his literary stature
in his own eyes as not infrequently happens, only
made him increasingly modest and diffident, that
he was sometimes supposed to care nothing for
his literary laurels. In one respect his success
was something of a disappointment to him, not so
much because it illustrated the truth of Goethe’s
saying&mdash;nearer seventy than sixty as Watts-Dunton
was when he achieved that success&mdash;“the wished-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>for
comes too late,” but because it was not the success
he expected and to which he believed himself most
to be entitled.</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas calls his book on Watts-Dunton
<cite>Theodore Watts-Dunton, Poet, Novelist, and Critic</cite>,
and the description and the order in which those
descriptions appear were of Watts-Dunton’s own
choosing. It was first as a poet, secondly as a
novelist, and only thirdly, if at all, as a critic, that
he wished and hoped to be remembered, whereas
those who held the balance of values in letters were
inclined to reverse that order and to place the critic
first and the poet last.</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton was&mdash;I would emphasise this
point strongly&mdash;an amateur in letters to the last,
never the professional “literary man.” It is
because he was by temperament the amateur, not
the professional, that he took his success so seriously
and did not conceal a certain almost childlike
gratification (which was not vanity) that it afforded
him. Your shrewd professional writer would have
spent less time in contemplation of his success,
and more in seeking how best to exploit and advertise
that success to his professional advantage.</p>

<p>Watts-Dunton, on the contrary, took the success
of <cite>Aylwin</cite> very much as a young mother takes her
firstling. He dandled it, toyed with it, hugged it,
not altogether without something of the wonder
and the awe with which a fond mother regards her
firstborn. An amateur, as I say, and to the last he
could hardly believe his own ears, his own eyes, at
finding that his work had a high “market” value,
and that one publisher was ready to bid against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
another for his next book. Truth to tell he was not
a little flustered by it all. “Hostages to posterity”
of his sort carried responsibilities with them, not the
least of which was the expectation that he would
follow up <cite>Aylwin</cite> with other books. I remember
the portentous, almost troubled knitting of his
brows when perhaps a little maliciously I hinted that
it was no use his bringing out new editions of
<cite>Aylwin</cite>, or brooding over new prefaces for new
editions of the same novel. “What your public
and your publishers demand from you,” I said,
“is <cite>Aylwin’s</cite> successor, not new editions, but a new
book.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said with deep meaning&mdash;no one could
put so much into an “ah” as he&mdash;and, figuratively,
collapsed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_111" class="vspace">ONE ASPECT OF THE MANY-SIDEDNESS OF<br />
THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I have</span> often been asked by those who did not
know Theodore Watts-Dunton what was the
secret of the singular power he appeared to
exercise over others and the equally singular affection
in which he was held by his friends.</p>

<p>My answer was that Watts-Dunton’s hold upon
his friends, partly personal as it was and partly intellectual,
was chiefly due to his extraordinary
loyalty. Of old, certain men and women were supposed
to be possessed of the “evil eye.” Upon
whom they looked with intent&mdash;be it man, woman,
or beast&mdash;hurt was sooner or later sure to fall.</p>

<p>If there be anything in the superstition, one might
almost believe that its opposite was true of Watts-Dunton.
He looked upon others merely to befriend,
and if he did not put upon them the spell, not of an
evil but of a good eye, he exercised a marvellous
personal power, not, as is generally the case, upon
weaker intellects and less marked personalities than
his own, but upon his peers; and even upon those
whom in the world’s eye would be accounted greater
than he. That any one man should so completely
control, and even dominate, two such intellects as
Swinburne and Rossetti seemed almost uncanny.
I never saw Rossetti and Watts-Dunton together,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
for the former had been dead some years when I first
met Watts-Dunton, but my early literary friendships
were with members of the little circle of which
Rossetti was the centre, and all agree in their testimony
to the extraordinary personal power which
Watts-Dunton exercised over the poet-painter. But
Swinburne&mdash;and here I speak with knowledge&mdash;Watts-Dunton
absolutely dominated. It was,
“What does Walter say about it?” “Walter
thinks, and I agree with him, that I ought to do so
and so,” or, “Let us submit the matter to Watts-Dunton’s
unfailing judgment.”</p>

<p>Here, for fear of a possible misunderstanding, let
me say that, if any reader assume from what I have
just written that Swinburne was something of a
weakling, that reader is very much mistaken. It is
true that the author of <cite>Atalanta in Calydon</cite> was a
greater force in intellect and in imagination than in
will power and character, but he was not in the
habit of deferring to others as he deferred to Watts-Dunton,
and when he chose to stand out upon some
point, or in some opinion, he was very difficult to
move. It was only, in fact, by Watts-Dunton that he
was entirely manageable, yet there was never any
effort, never even any intention on Watts-Dunton’s
part to impose his own will upon his friend. I have
heard his influence upon Swinburne described as
hypnotic. From that point of view I entirely dissent.
Watts-Dunton held his friends by virtue of his
genius for friendship&mdash;“Watts is a hero of friendship,”
Mr. William Michael Rossetti once said of
him&mdash;and by the passionate personal loyalty of
which I have never known the equal. By nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the kindest of men, shrinking from giving pain to
any living creature, he could be fierce, even ferocious,
to those who assailed his friends. It was, indeed,
always in defence of his friends, rarely if ever in
defence of himself&mdash;though he was abnormally
sensitive to adverse criticism&mdash;that he entered into
a quarrel and, since dead friends could not defend
themselves, he constituted himself the champion of
their memory or of their reputation, and even
steeled himself on more than one occasion to a break
with a living friend rather than endure a slight to
one who was gone. “To my sorrow,” he writes in
a letter, “I was driven to quarrel with a man I
loved and who loved me, William Minto, because
he, with no ill intentions, printed certain injurious
comments upon Rossetti which he found in Bell
Scott’s papers.”</p>

<p>It was my own misfortune, deservedly or undeservedly,
to have a somewhat similar experience
to that of Professor Minto; but in my case the
estrangement, temporary only as it was, included
Swinburne as well as Watts-Dunton. In telling the
story, and for the first time here, I must not be
supposed for one moment to imagine that any
importance attaches or could attach to a misunderstanding
between such men as Swinburne and
Watts-Dunton and a scribbler of sorts like myself,
but because a third great name, that of Robert
Buchanan, comes into it.</p>

<p>It is concerned with Buchanan’s attack upon
Rossetti in the famous article <cite>The Fleshly School
of Poetry</cite>, which appeared anonymously (worse&mdash;pseudonymously)
in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite>. Not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
long after Buchanan’s death I was asked to review
Mr. Henry Murray’s <cite>Robert Buchanan and other
Essays</cite> in a critical journal, which I did, and
Swinburne and Watts-Dunton chanced to see the
article. To say that they took exception to what
I said about Buchanan, would be no description of
their attitude, for Swinburne not only took exception
but took offence and of the direst&mdash;so much so
as to make it necessary that for a season I should
discontinue my visits to The Pines.</p>

<p>And here let me interpolate that I entirely agree
with Mr. James Douglas when he says in his volume,
<cite>Theodore Watts, Poet, Novelist and Critic</cite>, “It would
be worse than idle to enter at this time of the day
upon the painful subject of the Buchanan affair.
Indeed, I have often thought it is a great pity that
it is not allowed to die out.” But when in the next
sentence Mr. Douglas goes on to say, “The only
reason why it is still kept alive seems to be that,
without discussing it, it is impossible fully to understand
Rossetti’s nervous illness about which so
much has been said,” I am entirely out of agreement
with him, as the quotation which I make from
my article will show. Since Mr. Douglas <em>has</em> reopened
the matter&mdash;he could hardly do otherwise
in telling the story of Watts-Dunton’s literary life&mdash;I
have the less hesitation in reprinting part of the
article in which I endeavoured to clear Buchanan
of what I held, and still hold, to be a preposterous
charge. I may add that I quite agree with Mr.
Douglas when he says that we must remember “the
extremely close intimacy which existed between
these two poet friends (Rossetti and Watts-Dunton)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
in order to be able to forgive entirely the unexampled
scourging of Buchanan in the following
sonnet, if, as some writers think, Buchanan was
meant.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas then quotes the sonnet <cite>The Octopus
of the Golden Isles</cite>, which I do not propose
here to reprint. That Buchanan was meant is now
well known, and in fact Mr. Douglas himself says
in the same chapter that Watts-Dunton’s definition
of envy as the “literary leprosy” has often been
quoted in reference to the case of Buchanan. My
article on Buchanan is too long to give in its entirety,
and, even omitting the passages with no
direct bearing upon the misunderstanding which it
caused, is lengthier than I could wish. My apology
is, first, that in justice to Watts-Dunton and to Swinburne
I must present their case against me ungarbled.
Moreover, as the foolish bogey-story&mdash;like
an unquiet ghost which still walks the world
unlaid&mdash;that Buchanan was the cause of Rossetti
taking to drugs, the cause even of Rossetti’s death,
is still repeated, and sometimes believed, I am not
sorry of another and last attempt to give the bogey
its <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quietus</i>. Here are the extracts from my article:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Murray quotes evidently with appreciation
Buchanan’s tribute to his ancient enemy Rossetti,
I do not share Mr. Murray’s appreciation, for
Buchanan’s tribute has always seemed to me more
creditable to his generosity than to his judgment.
He speaks of Rossetti as ‘in many respects
the least carnal and most religious of modern
poets.’</p>

<p>“Here he goes to as great an extreme as when he so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
savagely attacked Rossetti as ‘fleshly.’ About
this attack much nonsense has been written. We
have been told that it was the cause of Rossetti’s
taking to chloral; and I have heard even Rossetti’s
death laid at Buchanan’s door. To my thinking
talk of that sort is sheer nonsense. If Rossetti took
to chloral because Buchanan called his poetry
‘fleshly,’ Rossetti would sooner or later have taken
to chloral, had Buchanan’s article never been
written. But when Buchanan in the fulness of his
remorse calls Rossetti ‘the most religious of modern
poets’ he is talking equally foolishly.</p>

<p>“Rossetti ‘the most religious of modern poets’!
Why, Rossetti’s religion was his art. To him art
was in and of herself pure, sacred, and inviolate.
By him the usual order of things was reversed. It
was religion which was the handmaid, art the
mistress, and in fact it was only in so far as religion
appealed to his artistic instincts that Rossetti can
be said to have had any religion at all.</p>

<p>“And when Buchanan sought to exalt Rossetti to
a pinnacle of purity he was guilty of a like extravagance.
That Rossetti’s work is always healthy not
even his most enthusiastic admirers could contend.
Super-sensuous and southern in the warmth of
colouring nearly all his poems are. Some of them
are heavy with the overpowering sweetness as of
many hyacinths. The atmosphere is like that of a
hothouse in which, amid all the odorous deliciousness,
we gasp for a breath of the outer air again.
There are passages in his work which remind us far
more of the pagan temple than of the Christian
cloister, passages describing sacred rites which pertain
not to the worship of the Virgin, but to the
worship of Venus.</p>

<p>“Buchanan was a man who lived heart and soul in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the mood of the moment. He had a big brain which
was quick to take fire, and at such times, both in his
controversies and in his criticism, he was apt to
express himself with an exaggeration at which in
his cooler hours he would have been the first to hurl
his Titanic ridicule.</p>

<p>“It may seem ungenerous to say so, but even his
beautiful dedicatory poem to Rossetti strikes me
as a lapse into false sentiment.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>To An Old Enemy</i></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would have snatched a bay-leaf from thy brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wronging the chaplet on an honoured head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace and tenderness I bring thee now<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lily-flower instead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pure as thy purpose, blameless as thy song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sweet as thy spirit may this offering be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget the bitter blame that did thee wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And take the gift from me.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“After Rossetti’s death, ten months later, Buchanan
added the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Calmly, thy royal robe of Death around thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou sleepest, and weeping brethren round thee stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gently they placed, ere yet God’s angel crowned thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My lily in thy hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never saw thee living, oh, my brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But on thy breast my lily of love now lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by that token we shall know each other,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When God’s voice saith ‘Arise!’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“That this is very beautiful every one will admit,
but is it true to picture those who most loved Rossetti
as placing Buchanan’s lily of song in his dead
hand? I think not. Nor can those who know anything
of the last days of Rossetti reconcile the facts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
with Buchanan’s imaginary picture of a sort of
celestial assignation in which, by means of a lily,
Rossetti and his ancient enemy and brother poet
shall identify each other on the Last Day?</p>

<p>“I am well aware that I shall be accused of bad
taste, even of brutality, in saying this; but, as Mr.
Murray himself alludes to this ancient quarrel, I
must protest that false sentiment is equally abhorrent&mdash;as
Buchanan would have been the first to
admit. Now that Buchanan has followed Rossetti
where all enmities are at an end, it is right that the
truth about the matter be spoken, and this unhappy
assault and its not altogether happy sequel
be alike forgotten.</p>

<p>“Robert Buchanan’s last resting-place is within
sight of the sea. And rightly so. It is his own heart
that Old Ocean seems most to wear away in his
fretting and chafing, and the wearing away of their
own heart is the most appreciable result of the warfare
which such men as Buchanan wage against the
world.</p>

<p>“That he did not fulfil his early promise, that he
frittered away great gifts to little purpose, is pitifully
true, but if he flung into the face of the men
whom he counted hypocrites and charlatans, words
which scorched like vitriol, he had, for the wounded
in life’s battle, for the sinning, the suffering, and the
defeated, words of helpful sympathy and an outstretched
hand of practical help.</p>

<p>“Mr. Murray has shown Buchanan to us as he was;
no hero perhaps, certainly not a saint, but a man of
great heart and great brain, quick to quarrel, but as
quick to own himself in the wrong; a man intensely,
passionately human, with more than one
man’s share of humanity’s weaknesses and of
humanity’s strength, a sturdy soldier in the cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
of freedom, a fierce foe, a generous friend, and a
poet who, in regard to that rarest of all gifts, ‘vision,’
had scarcely an equal among his contemporaries.</p>

<p>“I must conclude by a serious word with Mr.
Murray. Disagree with him as one may and must,
one cannot but admire his fearless honesty. None
the less I am of opinion that in the following passage
Mr. Murray’s own pessimism has led him to do his
dead friend’s memory a grievous injustice.</p>

<p>“‘From the broken arc we may divine the perfect
round, and it is my fixed belief that, had the subtle
and cruel malady which struck him down but spared
him for a little longer time, he would logically have
completed the evolution of so many years, and have
definitely proclaimed himself as an agnostic, perhaps
even as an atheist.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Murray’s personal knowledge of Buchanan
was intimate, even brotherly; mine, though dating
many years back, was comparatively slight. But
I have read Buchanan’s books, and I know something
of the spirit in which he lived and worked, and
I am convinced that Mr. Murray is wrong. It is not
always those who have come nearest to the details
of a man’s daily life, who have come nearest to him
in spirit, as Amy Levy knew well when she wrote
those lines, <cite>To a Dead Poet</cite>, which I shall be
pardoned for bringing to my readers’ remembrance:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I knew not if to laugh or weep:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They sat and talked of you&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">’Twas that he used to do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Here is the book wherein he read,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The room wherein he dwelt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he’ (they said) ‘was such a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such things he thought and felt.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sat and sat, I did not stir;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They talked and talked away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was as mute as any stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I had no word to say.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They talked and talked; like to a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My heart grew in my breast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, who had never seen your face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perhaps I knew you best.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Buchanan was, as every poet is, a creature of
mood, and in certain black moods he expressed
himself in language that was open to an atheistic
interpretation. There were times when he was
confronted by the fact that, to human seeming,
iniquity prospered, righteousness went to the wall,
and injustice, vast and cruel, seemed to rule the
world. To the Christian belief that the Cross
of Christ is the only key to the terrible problem
of human suffering, Buchanan was unable to subscribe,
and at times he was tempted to think
that the Power at the head of things must be
evil, not good. It seems to me that at such times
he would cry out in soul-travail, ‘No! no! anything
but that! If there be a God at all He must be
good. Before I would do God the injustice of believing
in an evil God, I would a thousand times
sooner believe in no God at all!’ Then the mood
passed; the man’s hope and belief in an unseen
beneficent Power returned, but the sonnet in which
he had given expression to that mood remained.
And because the expression of that mood was permanent,
Mr. Murray forgets that it was no more
than the expression of a mood, and tells us that he
believes, had Buchanan lived longer, he would have
become an atheist.</p>

<p>“Again I say that I believe Mr. Murray to be
wrong. Buchanan, like his own Wandering Jew,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
trod many dark highways and byways of death, but
he never remained&mdash;he never could have remained&mdash;in
that Mortuary of the Soul, that cul-de-sac of
Despair which we call Atheism.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“This is not the place in which to say it, but perhaps
my editor will allow me to add how keenly I
felt, as I stood by the graveside of Robert Buchanan
in that little God’s acre by the sea, the inadequacy
of our Burial Service, beautiful as it is, in the case
of one who did not profess the Christian faith. To
me it seemed little less than a mockery to him who
has gone, as well as a torture to those who remain,
that words should be said over his dead body which,
living, he would have repudiated.</p>

<p>“Over the body of one whose voice is silenced by
death, we assert the truth of doctrines which living
he had unhesitatingly rejected. It is as if we would,
coward-like, claim in death what was denied us in
life.</p>

<p>“In the case of a man whose beliefs were those of
Robert Buchanan, how much more seemly it would
be to lay him to rest with some such words as these:</p>

<p>“‘To the God from Whom he came, we commend
this our friend and brother in humanity, trusting
that what in life he has done amiss, may in death be
forgotten and forgiven; that what in life he has
done well, may in death be borne in remembrance.
And so from out our human love, into the peace of
the Divine love, we commend him, leaving him with
the God from Whom, when we in our turn come to
depart whither he has gone, we hope to receive like
pardon, forgiveness and peace. In God’s hands, to
God’s love and mercy, we leave him.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>Re-reading this article many years after it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
written, I see nothing in it to which friendship or
even affection for either Rossetti or Buchanan could
reasonably object.</p>

<p>This was not the view taken by Swinburne and
Watts-Dunton. It so happened that I encountered
the latter in the Strand a morning or two later, and
more in sadness than in anger he reproached me with
“disloyalty to Gabriel, disloyalty to Algernon, and
disloyalty to myself.”</p>

<p>I replied that touching Rossetti, as he did not
happen to be the King, had never so much as heard
of my small existence, nor had I ever set eyes upon
him, to accuse me of disloyalty to him, to whom
I owed no loyalty, struck me as a work of supererogation.
And, as touching Swinburne and Watts-Dunton
himself, honoured as I was by the high
privilege of their friendship, I could not admit that
that friendship committed me to a blind partisanship
and to the identification of myself with their
literary likings or dislikings or their personal
quarrels.</p>

<p>My rejection of the penitential rôle, to say nothing
of my refusing to take the matter seriously, seemed
to surprise and to trouble Watts-Dunton. While
protesting the regard of every one at The Pines
for me personally, he gave me to understand that
Swinburne in particular was so wounded by my
championship as he called it of Buchanan, that he
would have some trouble in making my peace in
that quarter, and even hinted that an arrangement,
by which I was either to lunch or to dine at The
Pines within the next few days, had better stand
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Naturally I replied&mdash;I could hardly do otherwise,
as I did not see my way without insincerity to express
regret for what I had written about Buchanan,
though I did express regret that it had given offence
to Swinburne and himself&mdash;that that must be as he
chose, and so we parted, sadly on my side if not on
his; and I neither saw nor heard from anyone at
The Pines for some little time after. Then one
morning came the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">Don’t think any more of that unpleasant
little affair. Of course neither Swinburne nor I
expect our friends, however loyal, to take part in
the literary quarrels that may be forced upon us.
But this man had the character <em>among men who
knew him well</em> of being the most thorough sweep,
and to us it did seem queer to see your honoured
name associated with such a man. But, after all,
even he may not have been as black as his acquaintances
painted him. Your loyalty to us I do not
doubt.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Theodore Watts-Dunton</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This was followed by a wire&mdash;from Swinburne&mdash;asking
me to lunch, which I need hardly say I was
glad to accept, and so my relationship to the inmates
of The Pines returned to its old footing.</p>

<p>Since it was Swinburne much more than Watts-Dunton
who so bitterly resented what I had written
of Buchanan, I am glad to have upon my shelves a
volume of <cite>Selections from Swinburne</cite>, published<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
after his death, and edited by Watts-Dunton. The
book was sent to me by the Editor, and was inscribed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">
“To Coulson Kernahan,
</p>

<p class="in0">whom Swinburne dearly loved, and who as
dearly loved him.</p>

<p class="center">
From Theodore Watts-Dunton.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>My unhappy connection with the “Buchanan
affair” had, it will be seen, passed entirely from
Swinburne’s memory, and indeed the name of Robert
Buchanan, who was something of a disturbing
element even in death, as he had been in life, was
never mentioned among us again. How entirely
the, to me, distressing if brief rift in my friendship
with Watts-Dunton&mdash;a friendship which I shall
always count one of the dearest privileges of my
life&mdash;was closed and forgotten, is clear from the
following letter. It was written in reply to a telegram
I sent, congratulating him on celebrating his
81st birthday&mdash;the last birthday on earth, alas,
of one of the most generous and great-hearted of
men:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">The Pines, Putney, S.W.</span><br />
<span class="l2"><i>Oct. 20th, 1913.</i></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">Your telegram congratulating me upon
having reached my 81st birthday affected me deeply.
Ever since the beginning of our long intimacy I have
had from you nothing but generosity and affection,
almost unexampled, I think, between two literary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
men. My one chagrin is that I can get only glimpses
of you of the briefest kind. Your last visit here was
indeed a red-letter day. Don’t forget when occasion
offers to come and see us. Your welcome will be of
the most heartfelt kind.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Most affectionately yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Theodore Watts-Dunton</span>

WATTS-DUNTON</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> pathetic side of the last two or three
years of Watts-Dunton’s life was that he
had outlived nearly every friend of youth
and middle age, and, with the one or two old friends
of his own generation who survived, he had lost
touch. Tennyson, Rossetti, Swinburne, William
Morris, Browning, Matthew Arnold, Borrow, William
Black, Dr. Gordon Hake, Westland and Philip
Marston, Jowett, Louise Chandler Moulton, William
Sharp, James Russell Lowell, George Meredith, were
gone. Mr. William Rossetti, the only one of the old
fraternity left, now rarely, he tells me, leaves his
own home. In any case he and Watts-Dunton had
not met for years. Mr. Edmund Gosse, once a
frequent and always an honoured visitor to The
Pines, was rarely if ever there during the years that
I came and went.</p>

<p>It was between Swinburne and Mr. Gosse that the
intimacy existed, though by both the inmates he
was to the last held in high regard. Mr. Gosse would
have the world to believe that he grows old, but no
one who knows him either personally or by his
writings can detect any sign of advancing years. On
the contrary, both in the brilliance of his personality
and of his later intellectual achievements, he appears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to possess the secret of eternal youth. It was
neither oncoming years nor any lessening of friendship
between him and Swinburne which was responsible
for Mr. Gosse’s defection, but the fact that he
had added to his other duties that of Librarian to
the House of Lords. This, and his many and increasing
official and literary activities, kept, and
keep him closely occupied, and so it was that his
name gradually, insensibly, dropped out of the list
of visitors at The Pines.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Hake was with Watts-Dunton to the
end, and indeed it was not a little due to the help of
“The Colonel” (the name by which from his boyhood
Mr. Hake was known at The Pines on
account of his cousinship with and his likeness to
Colonel, afterwards General Charles Gordon) that
Watts-Dunton accomplished so much literary work
in his last decade. Some of the younger men, Mr.
Clement Shorter, accompanied now and then by
his poet-wife, Mr. James Douglas, Mr. Henniker-Heaton,
Dr. Arthur Compton-Rickett, and Mr. F.&nbsp;G.
Bettany, remained in touch with The Pines until
Watts-Dunton’s death. I met none of them there
myself, as after I went to live a long way
from London my own visits were less frequent,
and being a friend of older standing, with
memories in common which none of the newer
friends whom I have mentioned shared, it was
generally arranged that I was the only guest. That
there was no forgetfulness or lessening of friendship
on Watts-Dunton’s part towards the friends whom
he now rarely met, is evident by the following extract
from a letter in reply to a question on my part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
whether it would be possible for him to be my guest
at one of the Whitefriars’ Club weekly gatherings.</p>

<p>“I should look forward,” he said, “to seeing some
of the truest and best friends I have in the world,
including yourself, Robertson Nicoll, Richard Whiteing,
and Clement Shorter. And when you tell me
that F.&nbsp;C. Gould is a Friar (the greatest artistic
humorist now living in England) I am tempted indeed
to run counter to my doctor’s injunctions
against dining out this winter.</p>

<p>“The other day I had the extreme good luck to
find and buy the famous lost water-colour drawing
of the dining-room at 16 Cheyne Walk, with Rossetti
reading out to me the proofs of <cite>Ballads and
Sonnets</cite>. I am sending photographs of it to one or
two intimate friends, and I enclose you one. The
portrait of Rossetti is the best that has ever been
taken of him.”</p>

<p>Of all the friendships which Watts-Dunton formed
late in life none was so prized by him as that with
Sir William Robertson Nicoll. As it was I who made
the two known to each other, and in doing so, removed
an unfortunate and what might have been
permanent misunderstanding, I may perhaps be
pardoned for referring to the matter here.</p>

<p>The name of Sir William coming up one day in a
conversation, I discovered to my surprise that
Watts-Dunton was feeling sore about some disparaging
remark which Sir William was supposed
to have made about him. I happened to know how
the misunderstanding came about, and I told Watts-Dunton
the following true story, illustrating how
easily such misunderstandings arise, and illustrating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
too the petty and “small beer” side of “literary
shop” gossip. It concerned an editor and an
author. The author employed a literary agent, who
offered the editor one of the author’s stories. “I
have set my face against the middleman in literature,”
the editor replied. “If Mr. &mdash;&mdash; likes to offer
me his story direct, I’ll gladly take it, and pay his
usual price per thousand words, but buy it through
an agent I won’t.”</p>

<p>This came to the ears of the author, who remarked:
“That’s rather unreasonable on &mdash;&mdash;’s
part. I buy, through an agent, the periodical he
edits. I don’t expect him to stand in the gutter, like
a newsboy, selling me his paper himself at a street
corner, and I don’t see why he should object to
my offering him my wares by means of an
agent.”</p>

<p>This not unfriendly remark was overheard by
some one, who told it to some one else, who repeated
it to another person, that person in his turn passing
it on, and so it went the round of Fleet Street and
certain literary clubs. The copper coinage of petty
personal gossip, unlike the pound sterling coin of the
realm, becomes magnitudinally greater, instead of
microscopically less, by much circulation. Instead
of infinitesimal attritions, as in the case of the coin,
there are multitudinous accretions, until the story
as it ultimately started life, and the story as it afterwards
came to be told, would hardly recognise each
other, at sight, as blood relatives. By the time the
innocent remark of the author came to the ears of
the editor concerned, it had so grown and become
so garbled, that its own father would never have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
known it. “Have you heard what So-and-so the
author said about you?” the editor was asked.
“He said that he hoped to live to see you in the
gutter, selling at the street corner the very paper
you now edit.” Not unnaturally the editor’s retort
was uncomplimentary to the author, who, when the
retort came to his ears, expressed an opinion about
the editor which was concerned with other matters
than the editorial objection to the middleman in
literature, and so a misunderstanding (fortunately
long since removed) arose in good earnest.</p>

<p>I should not put this chronicle of journalistic
small beer&mdash;a version as it is of the famous Three
Black Crows story&mdash;on record, were it not that it
was exactly in the same way that an innocent remark
of Sir William Robertson Nicoll’s had been
misrepresented to Watts-Dunton. This I did my
best to explain to the latter, but not feeling as sure
as I wished to be that all soreness was removed, I
asked him to lunch with me at the Savage Club, and
then invited Dr. Nicoll, as he then was, to meet him.
There was at first just a suspicion of an armed truce
about Watts-Dunton, in whose memory the supposed
attack upon himself was still smouldering, but
his interest and pleasure in the conversation of a
student and scholar of like attainments to his own
soon dispelled the stiffness. A chance but warmly
affectionate reference to Robertson Smith by Dr.
Nicoll drew from Watts-Dunton that long-drawn
“Ah!” which those who knew him well remember
as meaning that he was following with profound
attention and agreement what was being
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
“Why, I knew that man&mdash;one of the salt of the
earth,” he interpolated. Then he added gravely,
more reminiscently than as if addressing anyone,
“I had affection for him!” Leaning over the table,
his singularly brilliant and penetrating eyes full
upon the other, he said almost brusquely, “Tell me
what you knew of Robertson Smith!”</p>

<p>Dr. Nicoll responded, and within five minutes’ time
the two of them were talking together, comparing
notes and exchanging experiences and confidences
like old friends. As we were parting, Watts-Dunton
said to me:</p>

<p>“You are coming to lunch on Monday. I wish
I could persuade our friend Nicoll here to accompany
you, so that Swinburne could share the
pleasure of such another meeting as we have had
here to-day.”</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted by Dr. Nicoll with
the cordiality with which it was offered, and I may
add with the usual result, for the intervener. “Patch
up a quarrel between two other persons&mdash;and find
yourself left out in the cold,” Oscar Wilde once
said to me. I had merely removed a misunderstanding,
not patched up a quarrel, but the result of my
bringing Watts-Dunton, Nicoll, and Swinburne
together was that, on the occasion of the first meeting
of all three, they had so much to talk about, and
talked about it so furiously, that I had cause to
ask myself whether the “two” in the proverb should
not be amended to “three,” so as to read “Three’s
company; four’s none.” Thereafter, and to his
life’s end, Watts-Dunton could never speak too
gratefully or too appreciatively of Sir William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Robertson Nicoll. He came indeed to hold the
latter’s judgment alike in literature and scholarship,
as in other matters, in the same admiration with
which Swinburne held the judgment of Watts-Dunton
himself.</p>

<p>Thus far it is only of Watts-Dunton’s friends that
I have written, reserving the last place in my list,
which in this case is the first in precedence, for the
only name with which it is fitting that, in my final
word, his name should be coupled. I have said that
the pathetic side of his later years was that he had
outlived so many of the men and women he loved.
To outlive one’s nearest and dearest friends must
always be poignant and pathetic, but in other respects
Watts-Dunton’s life was a full and a happy
one, and never more so than in these later years, for
it was then that the one who was more than friend,
the woman he so truly loved, who as truly loved
him, became his wife. In his marriage, as in his
friendships, Watts-Dunton was singularly fortunate.
Husband and wife entertained each for the other,
and to the last, love, reverence and devotion. If
to this Mrs. Watts-Dunton added exultant, even
jealous pride in her husband’s intellect, his great
reputation and attainments, he was even more
proud of her beauty and accomplishments, and his
one anxiety was that she should never know a care.
When last I saw them together&mdash;married as they
had then been for many years&mdash;it was evident that
Watts-Dunton had lost nothing of the wonder, the
awe, perhaps even the perplexity, with which from
his boyhood and youth he had regarded that mystery
of mysteries&mdash;womanhood. His love for her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
was deep, tender, worshipping and abiding, albeit
it had something of the fear with which one might
regard some exquisite wild bird which, of its own
choice, comes to the cage, and, for love’s sake, is
content to forgo its native woodland, content even
to rest with closed wings within the cage, while
without comes continually the call to the green field,
the great hills and the glad spaces between sea and
sky. Be that as it may, this marriage between a
young and beautiful woman&mdash;young enough and
beautiful enough to have stood for a picture of his
adored Sinfi Lovell of <cite>Aylwin</cite>, whom, in her own
rich gypsy type of beauty, Mrs. Watts-Dunton
strangely resembled&mdash;and a poet, novelist, critic
and scholar who was no longer young, no longer
even middle-aged, was from first to last a happy one.
It is with no little hesitation that I touch even thus
briefly and reverently upon a relationship too sacred
and too beautiful for further words. Even this
much I should not have said were it not that, in
marriages where some disparity of age exists, the
union is not always as fortunate, and were it not also
that I know my friend would wish that his love and
gratitude to the devoted wife, who made his married
years so supremely glad and beautiful, should not
go unrecorded.</p>

<p>The last time I saw Watts-Dunton alive was
shortly before his death. I had spent a long
afternoon with Mrs. Watts-Dunton and himself,
and at night he and I dined alone, as his wife
had an engagement. In my honour he produced a
bottle of his old “Tennyson” port, lamenting that
he could not join me as the doctor had limited him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
to soda-water or barley-water. When I told him
that I had recently been dining in the company of
Sir Francis Carruthers Gould, and that “F.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;G.”
had described soda-water as “a drink without a
soul,” Watts-Dunton was much amused. But, his
soulless drink notwithstanding, I have never known
him talk more brilliantly. He rambled from one
subject to another, not from any lack of power to
concentrate or lack of memory, but because his
memory was so retentive and so co-ordinating that
the mention of a name touched, as it were, an electric
button in his memory, which called up other associations.</p>

<p>And by rambling I do not mean that he was discursive
or vague. No matter how wide his choice of
subject, one was conscious of a sense of unity in all
that Watts-Dunton said. Religion might by others,
and for the sake of convenience, be divided into
creeds, Philosophy into schools of thought, Science
into separate headings under the names of Astronomy,
Geology, Zoology, Botany, Physics, Chemistry
and the like, but by him all these were considered
as component parts&mdash;the one dovetailing into the
other&mdash;of a perfect whole. One was conscious of no
disconnection when the conversation slid from this
science, that philosophy, or religion, to another, for
as carried on by him, it was as if he were presenting
to the observer’s eye merely different facets of the
precious and single stone of truth. His was not the
rambling talk of old age, for more or less rambling
his talk had been ever since I had known him.</p>

<p>It was due partly also to his almost infinite knowledge
of every subject under the sun. The mere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
mention of a science, of a language, of a system of
philosophy, of a bird, a flower, a star, was, as it were,
a text upon which he would base one of his wonderful
and illuminating disquisitions. His grasp of first
principles was so comprehensive that he was able
in a few words to present them boldly and clearly
for the hearer’s apprehension, whence he would pass
on to develop some new line of thought. His interests
were to the last so eager and youthful, that
even comparatively unessential side-issues&mdash;as he
spoke of them&mdash;suddenly opened up into new and
fascinating vistas, down which the searchlight of
his imagination would flash and linger, before passing
on, from point to point, to the final goal of his
thought.</p>

<p>Rossetti often said that no man that ever he met
could talk with the brilliancy, beauty, knowledge,
and truth of Watts-Dunton, whose very “improvisation”
in conversation Rossetti described as
“perfect” as a “fitted jewel.” Rossetti deplored,
too, on many occasions his “lost” conversations
with the author of <cite>Aylwin</cite>&mdash;lost because only by
taking them down in shorthand, as spoken, could
one remember the half of what was said, its incisive
phrasing, its flashing metaphors and similes, and the
“fundamental brain work” which lay at the back
of all.</p>

<p>I am always glad to remember that on this, my
last meeting with Watts-Dunton, he was&mdash;though
evidently weakening and ailing in body&mdash;intellectually
at his best. He revived old memories of
Tennyson, Rossetti, Browning, Lowell, Morris,
Matthew Arnold, and many another. He dwelt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
lovingly once again but with new insight upon the
first awakening of the wonder-sense in man, and
how this wonder-sense&mdash;the beginning whether in
savage or in highly civilised races of every form of
religion&mdash;passed on into worship. Our intercourse
that evening was in fact more of a monologue, on his
part, than of the usual conversation between two old
friends, with interests and intimates in common.
I was indeed glad that it should be so, first because
Watts-Dunton, like George Meredith (whose talk,
though I only heard it once, struck me if more
scintillating also as more self-conscious), was a compelling
and fascinating conversationalist, and
secondly because his slight deafness made the usual
give-and-take of conversation difficult.</p>

<p>Not a little of his talk that night was of his wife,
his own devotion to her, and the unselfishness of
her devotion to him. He spoke of Louise Chandler
Moulton, “that adorable woman,” as he called her,
whom Swinburne held to be the truest woman-poet
that America has given us. He charged me to carry
his affectionate greetings to Robertson Nicoll.
“Only I wish I could see more of him,” he added.
“It’s hard to see so seldom the faces one longs to
see.”</p>

<p>And then, more faithful in memory to the dead
friends of long ago than any other man or woman
I have known, he spoke movingly of “our Philip,”
his friend and mine, Philip Marston. Then he took
down a book from a little bookshelf which hung to
the right of the sofa on which he sat, and, turning
the pages, asked me to read aloud Marston’s
Sonnet to his dead love:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It must have been for one of us, my own,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To drink this cup and eat this bitter bread.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had not my tears upon thy face been shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy tears had dropped on mine; if I alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not walk now, thy spirit would have known<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My loneliness; and did my feet not tread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This weary path and steep, thy feet had bled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mine, and thy mouth had for mine made moan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so it comforts me, yea, not in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To think of thine eternity of sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To know thine eyes are tearless though mine weep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when this cup’s last bitterness I drain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One thought shall still its primal sweetness keep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hadst the peace, and I the undying pain.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>His only comment on the poem was that long and
deeply-breathed “Ah!” which meant that he had
been profoundly interested, perhaps even profoundly
stirred. Often it was his only comment when Swinburne,
head erect, eyes ashine, and voice athrill, had
in the past stolen into the same room&mdash;noiseless in
his movements, even when excited&mdash;to chaunt to us
some new and noble poem, carried like an uncooled
bar of glowing iron direct from the smithy of his
brain, and still intoning and vibrating with the deep
bass of the hammer on the anvil, still singing the
red fire-song of the furnace whence it came.</p>

<p>We sat in silence for a space, and then Watts-Dunton
said:</p>

<p>“Our Philip was not a great, but at least he
was a true poet, as well as a loyal friend and a
right good fellow. He is almost forgotten now by
the newer school, and among the many new voices,
but Louise Chandler Moulton and Will Sharp, and
others of us, have done what we could to keep his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
memory green. We loved him, as Gabriel and Algernon
loved him, our beautiful blind poet-boy.”</p>

<p>When soon after I rose reluctantly to go, a change
seemed to come over Watts-Dunton. The animation
faded out of voice and face, and was replaced
by something like anxiety, almost like pain.</p>

<p>“Must you go, dear fellow, must you go?” he
asked sorrowfully. “There is a bed all ready
prepared, for we’d hoped you’d stay the night.”</p>

<p>I explained that I was compelled to return to
Hastings that evening, as I had to start on a journey
early next morning. Perhaps I had let him overexert
himself too much in conversation. Perhaps
he had more to say and was disappointed not to be
able to say it, for he seemed suddenly tired and sad.
The brilliant talker was gone.</p>

<p>“Come again soon, dear fellow. Come again
soon,” he said, as he held my hand in a long clasp.
And when I had passed out of his sight and he
out of mine, his voice followed me pathetically,
almost brokenly into the night, “Come again soon,
Kernahan. Come again soon, dear boy. Don’t let
it be long before we meet again.”</p>

<p>It was not long before we met again, but it was,
alas, when I followed to his long home one who,
great as was his fame in the eyes of the world as poet,
critic, novelist and thinker, is, in the hearts of some
of us, who grow old, more dearly remembered as the
most unselfish, most steadfast, and most loving of
friends.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_139">WHEN STEPHEN PHILLIPS READ</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">One</span> afternoon in the nineties, I called upon
my friend Mrs. Chandler Moulton, the
American poet. She had taken a first-floor
suite of rooms in a large house in the west of London,
in which other paying guests were also just then
staying. I was shown into the reception room
attached to Mrs. Moulton’s suite, and was told that
she would be with me in a few minutes. Almost
immediately after, another of Mrs. Moulton’s
friends, Madame Antoinette Sterling, called, and was
shown into the room where I was waiting. We had
met before, and fell to chatting. Madame Sterling
happened to mention the piece in her repertoire,
which was not only her own favourite, but was also
that which, in her opinion, best suited her voice.
When I said that by some chance I had been so unfortunate
as to miss hearing her sing it, she replied
quickly:</p>

<p>“If that is so, I will sing it for you now.”</p>

<p>Then she rose, and drew herself up statuesquely&mdash;as
it were to “attention”&mdash;and to her full height, a
striking figure. Grant Allen once said to me that
he suspected she had a strain of Red Indian blood
in her veins. If that be so&mdash;I do not know&mdash;it
showed itself in a certain proud imperturbability of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
bearing, and by the fact that she stood, if not exactly
stock-still, at least almost motionless and gestureless.
It showed itself, too, in the high cheek-bones;
in the swarthiness of her complexion, and the snaky
smooth coils of black hair that, parted low and
loosely over the brow, toned down, and softened
into womanliness, the almost masculine massiveness
of the strong purposeful features. Throwing
back her head, like a full-throated thrush, and with
her hands clasped simply in front of her, she began
to sing, low and flute-like at first, but as she went
on letting her glorious voice swell out in an organ-burst
of song.</p>

<p>The effect was singular. The London season was
at its height, and the house was full of visitors,
chiefly, I believe, Americans. When Madame
Sterling began to sing, we could distinctly hear the
buzz of conversation coming up from the floor below.
Overhead, one could hear the restless movement of
feet, and sounds like those which come from a
kitchen&mdash;the chink of china and the clashing together
of knives, forks, and spoons, as if in preparation
for a meal&mdash;were also audible.</p>

<p>But as the first few notes of the rich, full, noble,
and far-carrying contralto rang out, the chatter of
voices below, the shuffle of feet, or of furniture overhead,
even the necessary commonplace, vulgar
sounds that came from the basement and the
kitchen, were suddenly checked, shamed, and
silenced; and, as the singer’s voice deepened into
full diapason, one almost fancied that not only the
men and women gathered together in different
rooms under that one roof, but the very house itself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
even the dead and inanimate pieces of furniture,
were strained and stilled in listening silence.</p>

<p>I am reminded of this old-time and almost forgotten
incident by an “Impression of Stephen
Phillips,” contributed under the initials “H.W.B.”
to the <cite>Outlook</cite> of December 18, 1915, by Mr. Horace
Bleackley, the distinguished novelist. Just as that
noisy boarding-house was at first surprised, and then,
as it were, frozen into a strange, almost uncanny
silence by Madame Sterling’s marvellous notes, so,
by the majesty of spoken words, Stephen Phillips
compelled an unwilling company to a like hushed
and awed reverence.</p>

<p>“It was an evening party in an undergraduate’s
rooms at Christ Church, Oxford, about twenty-seven
years ago,” writes Mr. Bleackley. “It was a
decorous gathering&mdash;not a ‘wine’&mdash;but there had
been music and mirth, and none of us were at all
inclined towards serious things. Suddenly the host
announced that a member of the Benson Company&mdash;several
of whom were our guests on this occasion&mdash;would
give a recitation. A grave and thoughtful
young man rose before us, with the features of a
Greek god, whom most of us recognised at a glance
(for we all had been at the theatre that week) as the
Ghost in <cite>Hamlet</cite>. Somewhat resentfully we relapsed
into silence, few showing any signs of enthusiasm,
for scarcely any of us had the slightest doubt that
we were going to be bored.</p>

<p>“For twenty minutes the actor held us spellbound.
His voice was musical and his elocution
that of a consummate artist. But this we had
realised before. It was not the charm of his diction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
that enthralled us, but the melody of his verse&mdash;fresh
and pure from the heavenly spring. And
when he had finished there were awestruck whispers&mdash;which
I seem to hear still&mdash;even from the Philistines:
‘It is his own poem!’ Few of that company
can have been surprised when, about a decade later,
all the world had hailed Stephen Phillips as one of
the greatest of living poets.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bleackley’s “Impression” was gathered long
before Phillips had reached the plenitude and the
maturity of his power, for the poet was then a very
young man, leaving Cambridge as he did without
taking a degree, and joining his cousin’s Sir F.&nbsp;R.
Benson’s touring theatrical company. Those who
heard Phillips at his prime and at his best, will agree
with me that his rendering of poetry cannot be
described by such words as “reading,” “recitation,”
or “recital.” The plain unexaggerated fact is that
by mere words his rendering of poetry cannot be
described.</p>

<p>I am not writing of his acting, nor of his public
reading, for, excellent and memorable as were both,
I doubt whether those who have heard and seen
Phillips only upon the stage, or the platform, have
any idea what he was like at his best&mdash;and at his
best he never was in public. It was in his own or in
a friend’s home, and in the company only of intimates,
of whose sympathy and understanding he
was assured, that Phillips was his natural self, and
therefore, his natural self (alas, that he was not
always that natural self!) being inherently noble,
at his highest and best. I have heard spiritualists
assert that the presence of one single person of unsympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
temperament has made it impossible
to attain the necessary trance condition on the part
of the medium, and so has brought a séance to
nought.</p>

<p>Whether that be so or not I cannot say, for I have
no knowledge of spiritualism, but I recall occasions
when Stephen Phillips had been strangely disappointing,
and, in explaining his failure to me
afterwards, he said:</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it. That man or that woman’s
very presence spoilt everything and put me off.
I seemed to feel his or her cold and fish-like
eyes fastened upon me as I read. I was all
the time as aware of that person’s boredom as
sailors are aware, by the change in the coldness of
the atmosphere, of approaching bergs. Worse, I
was like a skater, fallen into a hole under the ice;
who can find no way out, but is held down and
drowned under a roof of solid and unbroken ice.
One man, one woman, like that in my audience, or
even in a room, keeps me self-conscious all the time,
and so makes poetry impossible; for poetry, high
poetry, is the sublimation, the exaltation, of the
senses into soul. It is the forgetting of self, the
losing, merging and fusing of one’s very individuality
into pure thought, and into visions and revelations
of the Truth and the Loveliness that are of
God.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It has been my fortune to know not a few poets.
It has been my fate to play listener while they, or
most of them, read aloud their verses. To them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
presumably, some sort of satisfaction was to be
derived from the self-imposed task; otherwise I
should not have been thus afflicted. To me the case
was one of holding on, directly under the enemy’s
artillery and without returning his fire, the casualties
in my own moral garrison being heavy. I was
in fact for the most part as severely punished as was
Stephen Phillips on one occasion of which he told me.</p>

<p>The wife of a friend of his was chatting in her
drawing-room one afternoon with two or three
callers, among whom was Phillips. To them entered
the host her husband, who, drawing the author of
<cite>Marpessa</cite> aside, whispered to him, “Come along,
Phillips, let’s enjoy ourselves!”</p>

<p>“I was rather tiring of the drawing-room talk,”
said Phillips, in relating the incident, “and my
host’s alluring words were like Hope. They told a
flattering tale. ‘Rumour has it,’ I said to myself,
‘that there are in his cellars some bottles of port
upon which it is good to look when the colour is
tawny in the glass. Nectar for the gods, was the way
one connoisseur described it. Does this mean that
my host is going to crack a bottle in my honour?
Does this mean he is going to fit me out with one of
those choice cigars which he has also the reputation
of possessing?’ ‘Come along, Phillips, and let’s
enjoy ourselves!’ were his words.</p>

<p>“And what do you think happened? He lured
me away to a dark and chilly library, and read
Francis Thompson’s poems to me for three mortal
hours. If that is his idea of enjoying himself it isn’t
mine!”</p>

<p>Nor mine, I hasten to add, unless the reader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
were Stephen Phillips himself, to listen to whom
was the most exquisite artistic pleasure imaginable.
I agree with Mr. Bleackley that it was not Phillips’s
voice, nor his diction, nor his art that enthralled the
hearers, but I question whether Mr. Bleackley is
right in attributing the effect produced to the fact
that the poet was speaking his own poem. For that
effect was the same whether the poem were by
Phillips himself or by Shakespeare, Milton, Tennyson,
or Swinburne. In ordinary conversation
Phillips’s voice was not notably beautiful. It was
clear, musical, resonant, and finely modulated&mdash;that
was all. Had one done no more than talk with
him, I am not sure that his voice would thus far have
impressed itself upon the memory. But in speaking
poetry, his voice was as different from the voice to
which one was accustomed in conversation as is a
lit taper from the same taper when unkindled.
Poetry kindled the taper of his soul to flame, as only
poetry could. His genius was more supremely
evident at such times&mdash;that is to say, when he was
<em>living</em> poetry, when he was, as it were, caught up and
filled by some Pentecostal spirit of poetry outside
himself&mdash;than when he was, in travail and labour,
if under the pure impulse of inspiration, creating
poetry. Then from the man to whom we were
listening the fetters of the senses (alas, that those
fetters should sometimes hold so closely and so
heavily as to drag us downwards to earth!) seemed
to fall away, and his soul to soar back to the
heaven whence he had fallen.</p>

<p>He would begin to read or to recite with slow unemotional
deliberateness&mdash;the enunciation perfect,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and the voice exquisitely modulated&mdash;but at first
there was just a suspicion of a chant, an incantation,
as if by a spell to call up the Spirit of Poetry before
us. It was beautiful, it was the perfection of elocutionary
art, but for the time being it seemed cold and
afar from us and our lives, like the frozen marble
beauty of Greek statuary. Soon his voice would
deepen, and the room become strangely still. It was
the listeners now who reminded one of statuary, for
each sat unmoving, scarcely breathing, every sense,
every thought, centred on the reader who, his great
eyes ablaze, yet all unseeing, sat as if in a trance.
This was no longer Stephen Phillips, our friend and
intimate with whom we had walked and talked.</p>

<p>All of us know what it is suddenly and unexpectedly
to hear that we shall see on earth, no more, a
friend, who but yesterday was with us, and of us,
alive and well, his familiar and happy self. “No!
No! He is not dead! It cannot be! It must not
be!” we cry out when first told&mdash;as if death were
something unnatural and abnormal; as if it were but
some oversight, some mistake, against which we
have but to enter our protest, to move High God to
set it right. But even as we thus cry out, even as
we stagger back under the shock, and turn sick and
faint&mdash;so unendurable is our first sense of pity for
the dead&mdash;even then our pity passes, for we know
it is we, the living, not the dead, who are in need of
pity. Even then and thus early (so instantly ancient
is death, once we realise that it has come) some
strange new majesty, august and awful, has come
between our friend and us, as if to withdraw him an
æon and a world away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
And for the moment, and while the spell was upon
him, and upon us, the soul of Stephen Phillips, when
he was thus entranced by poetry, seemed scarcely
less far-removed from us, and from our little world,
than are the newly dead. For though to no mortal
has the soul of a man been visible, to some of us who
have listened to Stephen Phillips in those rare
moments, it seemed as if <em>the soul of a man had at
least become audible</em>.</p>

<p>Then, in some vague way, one’s thoughts wandered
back to the time when God walked in the
Garden in the cool of the evening, and His Voice was
heard by mortals. For then the exigencies of Time
and Space were abrogated. The little room, wherein
the poet sat and read, while we listened, was so
strangely transformed for us, that we saw the vision
of Dante and Milton unfold themselves before our
eyes. The poet could so speak a word as to make it
seem like the Spirit of God breathing upon the face
of the waters, and calling new worlds into being.
He could so speak that single word as to make it
almost a world in itself.</p>

<p>When in Swinburne’s second chorus in <cite>Atalanta
in Calydon</cite> Phillips came to the lines</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He weaves, and is clothed with derision,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sows, and he shall not reap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life is a watch or a vision<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Between a sleep and a sleep,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">with the last word “sleep,” as it came from Stephen
Phillips’s lips, the very world itself seemed to close
tired eyes, to wander away into unconsciousness,
and finally to fall on sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
James Russell Lowell once said that if Shakespeare
be read in the very presence of the sea itself,
his voice shall but seem the nobler, for the sublime
criticism of ocean; and the words recall Stephen
Phillips to me as I write, for in his voice, when he
was deeply stirred by poetry, there was something
measured, unhasting, majestic, like the vastness of
great waters, moving in flood of full tide under the
moon.</p>

<p>I have tried to give the reader some idea of his
rendering of poetry, and I have failed, for, as I have
already said, it cannot be described. Some godlike
spirit, outside himself, seemed, in these supreme
and consecrated hours, suddenly to possess him,
and, when the hour and the consecration were past,
as suddenly to leave him. But, while that hour
lasted, there was only one word for Stephen Phillips,
poet, and that word was Genius.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_149">EDWARD WHYMPER<br />

<span class="subhead">AS I KNEW HIM</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Though</span> I head this article “Edward
Whymper as I Knew Him,” I prefer first
to write of Edward Whymper as he was
before I knew him&mdash;or rather before he knew me.
In the town where he and I were then living he had
been dubbed “Bradlaugh turned Baedeker” by
one resident who insisted on Whymper’s likeness to
the late Charles Bradlaugh, and was aware that the
Great Mountaineer had written various “Guides.”
Another name by which he was known was “The
Sphinx,” possibly because of his silence, his aloofness,
and the mystery with which he was supposed
to surround himself. To the good folk of the town
he was indeed always something of an enigma. In
the street he stalked straightforwardly along, looking
only in front of him, set of mouth, stony of eye
and severe of brow, if anyone either spoke to, or
stared at him. On the journey up to London, when
most people read their morning paper, he was rarely
seen with a newspaper in his hand, but stared, pipe
in mouth, out of the window, except when going
through proofs or working at papers which he produced
from a black leather bag, without which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
was never seen in the train. On the journey down,
when work for the day was done, his would-be
sociable fellow passengers found Whymper taciturn
and reticent, responding, or rather not responding,
to any conversational advance, if possible, in a
monosyllable.</p>

<p>The town in question was Southend, where he
lived in Cliff Town Parade, and I, ten minutes’ walk
away at Westcliff. Though he contended that there
was no place within fifty miles of London with such
fine air, and though he never wearied (like Robert
Buchanan, who, as well as his brother poet, Sir
Edwin Arnold, was at one time a resident of Southend)
of extolling the atmospheric effects of sunshine
and shadow upon the saltings, and though (again
like Buchanan, who had said as much to me) he
vowed that nowhere else in England were there to
be seen more glorious pageants of sunrise and sunset&mdash;to
the people of Southend, especially to his fellow
travellers on the railway, he had taken an implacable
dislike. When in London I was first introduced
to him, he and I fell out upon the subject. Hearing
that I lived at Southend, he asked me whether I did
not agree with him that nowhere else would one
meet such objectionable folk as those who journeyed
backward and forward to town.</p>

<p>I replied that though Southend had no claim to
be the home of rank and fashion (overrun as it was
and is, during the summer months, by swarming
hordes of East End trippers), I had found my fellow
travellers and the residents generally&mdash;of the middle
classes as they admittedly were&mdash;cordial, sociable,
and kindly, and that for my part, so far from feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
as he did, I liked them and had many friends among
them.</p>

<p>This for some reason exasperated Whymper, who
launched out in fierce abuse of his unoffending fellow
townsmen.</p>

<p>“My good sir,” he stormed, “I ask you where
else in England, where else in God’s world if
you like, will you come across such a collection and
crew of defaulting solicitors, bagmen, undischarged
bankrupts, shady stockbrokers and stock jobbers,
potmen, pawnbrokers and publicans as on that particular
railway which you and I use?”</p>

<p>I did not agree with him, and told him so plainly
if courteously, whereupon, seeing that I was more
amused than annoyed by his storming, he suddenly
turned good-tempered, diverted the conversation
into other channels, and when we parted was quite
friendly.</p>

<p>His attitude on this occasion, as I afterwards discovered,
was characteristically Whymperian. He
could respect a man who stood up to him and was
undismayed by his storming; he had “no use,” as
the Americans say, for one who was ready cheaply
and insincerely to profess himself entirely in agreement.
He would at any time rather be bearded
than humoured, and the fact that on our first meeting
I refused to be browbeaten was, I now believe,
one of the reasons why he and I thereafter became
good friends.</p>

<p>One picture of Edward Whymper, as I saw him many
times, is vivid in my memory. The morning train to
town is on the point of starting, the guard has waved
his flag, blown his whistle, and is urging late comers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
to “hurry up.” Along the platform, indifferent to
the guard’s frantic arm-waving, never lengthening
his step by so much as one inch, never quickening
his pace by as much as by one second, but strolling
as leisurely as if the train were not to start for an
hour, and looking at each carriage for the face he is
seeking, walks a closely-knit, sturdily-built man of
middle height. His dress is unusual, as he is well
aware, accounting for it once by reminding me of a
great nobleman who, equally eccentric in the matter
of dress, remarked, “Where I live, every one knows
who and what I am, so it doesn’t matter what I wear.
In London no one knows who and what I am, so I
am equally free to please myself.”</p>

<p>More often than not Whymper, when going to town,
wore a black greatcoat over a woollen sweater, and
had a brown seal fur cap with lapels pulled down
over the ears and fastened under the chin, for, like
many who have spent much time in Canada, he felt
colder in the damp and foggy climate of England,
even when the temperature is moderate, than he did
in the drier, clearer atmosphere of the Great Dominion,
and when the thermometer stands at 40
degrees below zero.</p>

<p>But unusual as are a fur cap and sweater, when
worn as I have seen Whymper wear them even when
journeying to London, at the height of the season,
they struck one as less incongruous than the ill-brushed,
out-of-date silk hat in which, with black
leather or cloth leggings, he occasionally weirdly
arrayed himself. He sees my face at the window,
stops, and, as leisurely as he had walked, enters the
carriage and seats himself opposite to me, his back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
to the engine. To me he merely nods, or if on that
occasion inclined to be loquacious, goes so far as to
say “Good morning,” but never another word.
The other occupants of the compartment he either
entirely ignores or favours with a baleful glare. Then
he puts his bag upon his knee, produces a packet of
biscuits, and, looking out of the window all the time,
munches them with jaws that move as rhythmically
and methodically as if run by clockwork. His
breakfast of dry biscuits finished, he dives into his
bag for a flask, solemnly unscrews the stopper, as
solemnly lifts the flask to his mouth, takes a drink,
smacks his lips, replaces the stopper in the flask and
then the flask in the bag, snaps the lock and puts the
bag at his side. This done, he fishes in his pocket
for pipe, tobacco and matches, charges and lights
his pipe, takes with evident enjoyment two or three
long draws at it, sniffing possibly with relish and
with open nostrils at the smoke which rises from the
bowl, settles himself comfortably in his corner, and
then, and not till then, turns to me with a cheery
“Well, and how are you this morning?” I reply
with equal cheeriness, and probably the whole way
up to town we talk&mdash;only we two&mdash;incessantly.</p>

<p>But had I, <em>before</em> he had munched his biscuits,
swigged at his flask, replaced the latter in his bag,
lit his pipe and settled himself in the corner, addressed
him in any way, I should have had the
shortest of answers, and the chances are that for
the rest of the journey he would have remained
silent. That was Edward Whymper’s way, and a
man who liked more to have his own way I never
met. My liking was for himself, not for his ways;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
but since it was his whim to be let alone, to speak
to no one and to be spoken to by no one until he had
breakfasted and lit his pipe, I was quite willing so
to let him go his own way, knowing that soon the
oracle would speak of its own accord, and would say
many things which were well worth anyone’s
attention and hearing.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>“In the <cite>Memoir of Tennyson</cite> by his son, there will
be a letter&mdash;only one&mdash;to myself,” said Whymper
to me in 1897. “Except for the fact that it was one
of the last, if indeed not the very last letter Tennyson
penned, it doesn’t strike me as being important
enough for inclusion. But it has a curious history.
I had sent Tennyson a copy of one of my books,
<cite>Travels among the Great Andes of the Equator</cite>. Here
is his reply. I’ll read it to you:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="let">‘Accept my thanks for your most interesting
volume. I don’t think I have been higher than
about 7000 feet, and so I look on your Chimborazos
and Cotopaxis with all the greater veneration.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">‘Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>.’
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Now you can hardly call that a characteristic or
even a particularly interesting letter,” continued
Whymper, “but the writing appears to have given
the poet some trouble, for the present Lord Tennyson
tells me that, after his father’s death, he found
several drafts of it, I think he said six, in a blotting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
pad. It was, as I say, one of the last, if not the very
last letter Tennyson ever wrote, and one of two
things about it is true. Either his approaching end
had so affected his powers that he found it difficult
to frame even an ordinary letter of acknowledgment,
or else, realising that his letters would one
day inevitably be collected and printed, he was too
fastidious an artist to let even a casual note of
thanks come from his pen without striving to impart
to it some touch of distinction and originality, some
turn of a phrase which would give a hint of the
power and the personality of the writer. What’s
<em>your</em> solution of the problem?”</p>

<p>As I had no solution to offer, Whymper told me
another story of Tennyson, which by this time may
or may not&mdash;I do not know&mdash;have got into print.<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a>
But even if so&mdash;since I first heard it when it was
quite new, and since stories of the sort get varied
in the telling&mdash;there is some probability that
Whymper’s version is the correct one. I set it down,
as nearly as I can recollect, as he told it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Since this was written, I have told the story in a brief sketch of
Whymper that was published in a monthly magazine.</p></div>

<p>At a garden party, a rather gushing young girl
went up to the hostess and said: “Oh, is that really,
as I’m told, Lord Tennyson sitting there by himself
smoking on that rustic seat?” “Yes, my dear,
that is he,” was the reply. “He occasionally does
me the honour of calling to see me, and dropped in,
not knowing that I was entertaining to-day.” “Oh,
I should so like to meet him. Do introduce me,”
said the girl. “My dear, Lord Tennyson hates to
be bothered by strangers,” answered the hostess.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
“And one reason perhaps why he comes to see me
is that he knows I never exploit him in that way.”
“Oh, but I should love to be able to say I’ve met
him,” persisted the other. “Well, <em>say</em> you have
met him and leave it at that,” was the answer.
“Here you are and there he is, so it won’t be
altogether untrue. He won’t trouble to contradict
it if he ever heard it, which is not likely, and I’m
sure I shan’t.”</p>

<p>The girl, however, would take no refusal. Nothing
would content her but actually meeting and speaking
to Tennyson, so losing patience her hostess said:
“Very well. If he is rude to you&mdash;as he can be
to people who force themselves upon him&mdash;your
blood be upon your own head. You can’t say I
haven’t warned you. Come along.” “Lord
Tennyson,” said the hostess when the two had
walked together to the seat where the Laureate
was smoking, “this is Miss B&mdash;&mdash;, daughter of an
old friend of mine, who is very, very anxious to have
the honour of saying How-do-you-do to you.”
“How-d’you-do?” responded Tennyson gruffly,
and scarcely looking up.</p>

<p>Seating herself beside him the girl attempted
awkwardly to carry on some sort of conversation,
but, as all she got in reply was an occasional
“Humph!” or else stony silence, she lost her
nerve and began, schoolgirl-wise, to wriggle and
fidget in her seat. Then the Great Man spoke.
“You’re like the rest of them,” he grunted,
“you’re laced too tightly. I can hear your stays
creak.” Abashed and embarrassed the girl withdrew.
Later in the afternoon Tennyson came behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
her, and laying a hand on her shoulder, said kindly,
“I was wrong just now, young lady. It wasn’t your
stays I heard creaking, but my braces. They’re
hitched up too tightly. Sorry.” And he lounged
away.</p>

<p>The story may not be new and may not be true,
but Whymper found huge enjoyment in the telling
of it, possibly because he had himself the reputation
of sharing Tennyson’s dislike to the intrusive
stranger. To speak plainly indeed, Whymper could
be very rude, as witness the following incident. He
invited me once to accompany him to a lecture
given by a great climber. Soon after we had entered
the hall and before the lecture commenced, a man,
whom Whymper told me later he was sure he had
never set eyes on, bustled up to where we were
sitting, and extending a hand said effusively:</p>

<p>“Oh, how-do-you-do, Mr. Whymper? You won’t
remember me, but I had the pleasure of meeting
you in Switzerland.”</p>

<p>“No, I certainly don’t remember having had the
pleasure of meeting you,” was Whymper’s caustic
reply. “And I assure you my memory is of the
best.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I was afraid you wouldn’t remember me,”
answered the other still unabashed. “It was at
Zermatt. I knew your friend Leslie Stephen very
well.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” answered Whymper drily. “The
question is whether my friend Mr. Leslie Stephen
would be equally sure that he knew <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>If ever a man carried out in practice the precept:
“To know yourself is wisdom; not to know your
neighbours is genius,” that man was Edward
Whymper.</p>

<p>He had, it is true, a knack of scraping and continuing
acquaintance with neighbours and fellow
residents entirely out of his own station. From a
barber, a bird stuffer, a boatman or a net-mender
he would acquire a lot of out-of-the-way information,
and indeed would chat to them by the hour, if not
exactly with joviality, at least without the somewhat
pompous precision which at other times and in other
company he affected. But during the thirteen
years in which I was living at Westcliff and Whymper
was living at Southend, I was, I believe, the
only neighbour or fellow resident whose home he
ever entered or who was invited to visit his house.
If I use the word “house” rather than “home”
of the building in which he passed much of his life,
it is not merely because he had chambers at St.
Martin’s House, Ludgate Hill, but because a more
unhomelike place than Whymper’s Southend residence
can hardly be imagined. To ensure solitude
and quiet he had made an arrangement by which
he took practically the whole of what is called an
“apartment house.” It was a tall building with
basement rooms below and at least three storeys
above. In the top storey Whymper himself lived,
and in the very bottom, the basement in fact, his
housekeeper or landlady and her family had their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
rooms. All the intervening storeys were by Whymper’s
command left vacant. The windows, except
the basement, were curtainless, and Whymper’s own
room was carpetless and barrack-bare except for a
few necessary pieces of furniture, and photographs
of his own taking&mdash;peaks he had climbed, mountain
wastes and wildernesses he had explored, scenes on
the Canadian Pacific Railway and the like. On the
floor was a rolled-up mattress, to which he pointed.
“That,” he said, with a queer smile twisting at
the turned-down corners of his mouth, “is my
bed. The rugs and pillow are inside. At night I
unroll the thing, and there I am. What could be
simpler?”</p>

<p>And here I may remark that his habits in the
matter of sleeping were, like his habits in the matter
of meals, unusual. Four o’clock in the afternoon
was his favourite and not unfrequent hour for dining,
after which he would sometimes go to bed, getting
up again late in the evening for the nocturnal
rambles which he loved. I have often heard him
expatiate eloquently on the joys of finding himself
afoot and alone when more conventional folk
were abed, and I have known him extend his
tramps from past midnight till day was breaking.</p>

<p>That he and I came eventually to know each
other well, and to see each other frequently was due,
I am convinced, entirely to the fact that after our
introduction, except to nod when we passed in the
street or met at the railway station or in the train,
I left him severely alone. That, as I now know,
though I was unaware of it at the time, was the
surest passport to his favour. Rude even to bearishness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
as he could on occasion be, Whymper would
sometimes go out of his way to show courtesy and
even to enter into conversation with an entire
stranger. But in all such cases <em>the advance must
come from him</em>. If it came from the other, he was at
once on his dignity, withdrawing as instantly into
his shell as an alarmed snail. No curled hedgehog
could present a more prickly front than when in a
train, in a club, or elsewhere, some representative
of the lion-hunting fraternity, or of that class of
person who dearly loves to claim acquaintance with
a celebrity, made overtures to him; whereas, left
to himself, it often happened that, like the hedgehog,
he would of his own accord uncurl.</p>

<p>It was so in my own case. Instead of merely
nodding when we met, he took to stopping to exchange
a few words, telling me on one occasion that
I had very much alarmed him.</p>

<p>“How?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I have been reading a little book of yours, called
<cite>A Book of Strange Sins</cite>,” he answered. “From the
moment I first heard of it I was in terror lest my
own most secret and dearest sin had been exposed
and laid open to the light of day. But in searching
its pages anxiously and fearfully, I was relieved, not
to say reprieved, to find that my particular vices
have escaped your notice.”</p>

<p>Then, finding that though making no claim to
be a mountaineer I had done some small amount of
climbing in Switzerland and elsewhere, and finding,
moreover, that I made no further advances, he took
to joining me on my way backward and forward to
the station, becoming more and more friendly at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
each meeting, and finally he got in the habit of looking
out for me that he and I might travel up and
down together. Then he wrote:</p>

<p>“Come and crack a flask with me on Sunday
next any time you like after 8.30 p.m.”</p>

<p>I accepted the invitation, of which he again reminded
me when I met him in the street next
day.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget,” he said, “that you are supping
with me on Sunday any time that suits you after
half-past eight.”</p>

<p>At half-past eight on Sunday I was with him.</p>

<p>“I know you are a smoker,” he said, producing
a parcel of fat and long Manilla cigars, each carefully
cased in silver paper.</p>

<p>They had been in his possession, he told me
(I could well believe it), for twenty-five years,
and better cigars I have never smoked. Then,
as he happened to be in the mood for talking
and I am a good listener, he talked incessantly, incisively
and brilliantly till nine, ten, eleven had
come and gone, when frankly I began to feel hungry,
and no sign of supper. Twelve and half-past
twelve came, and I fear my attention wandered, for
I was trying to recall the condition of the joint
which had done duty among my own hungry family
some twelve hours before. Should the same joint
have reappeared at the table for the usual Sunday
night “cold supper,” the chances were that on returning
home I should be reduced to piratical raids
upon the larder in search of bread and cheese.</p>

<p>“And now, what do you say to supper?”
said Whymper, laying down the pipe at which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
he had been puffing with curious and rhythmic
regularity.</p>

<p>In smoking, as in everything else, he was methodical,
and had one counted the seconds that passed
between each puff, the intervals would have been
nearly identical.</p>

<p>Had I answered him truthfully I should have
replied, “Say? What can I say except ‘Thank
heaven!’ and that I’m starving?” instead of which
I answered with apparent politeness but hidden
irony:</p>

<p>“Thank you. When you’re quite ready.”</p>

<p>I regretted it the next moment, for, taking me
too literally at my word, he resumed his pipe,
relighted it, and pointing the stem at a photograph
of himself upon the mantelshelf, remarked:</p>

<p>“I’m extraordinarily particular about small
matters. Does anything strike you in that
portrait?”</p>

<p>“It’s a very good likeness,” I sighed, with a
strange sinking of the inner man, “and very characteristic,
inasmuch as you are smoking, if I
mistake not, that very pipe.”</p>

<p>He smiled cryptically.</p>

<p>“Does nothing else strike you? Look again!”</p>

<p>I groaned inwardly, but looked.</p>

<p>“And the same suit?”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said desperately, “you look so cheerful,
so well fed and so happy, that I can only suppose
you had just had your supper. Now as I lunched
at one o’clock and haven’t had as much as a sup of
tea since, I’m horribly hungry, and in want of mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Saying no more than a mere “Come along,” and
carrying the pipe and the photograph in his hand,
he led the way into the next room, where supper&mdash;all
cold&mdash;was upon the table. But such a supper!
Anchovies, chicken, calves’ foot jelly, clotted Devonshire
cream and other delicacies, with rare old Burgundy
and the best of champagne.</p>

<p>When I had been abundantly helped, Whymper
took up the photograph, and again pointing at it
with the pipe-stem, said:</p>

<p>“What I wondered was whether you’d notice
that the smoke coming from the bowl of the pipe
has been painted-in upon the negative. There was
no smoke visible in the original picture. When you
get to know me better you’ll find that I’m slow and
methodical but minutely accurate, even about little
things. I think you told me once that you set
some store by the many signed portraits that have
been given to you by your literary friends. Since
the portrait was the cause of keeping you from your
supper, and if you’d care to add so uncouth a face
as mine to your gallery, I’ll give it you. But I’ll
sign it first.”</p>

<p>It was well that he had warned me that he was
slow and methodical. Never was there such a
business as the signing of that portrait. First he
carefully washed and examined his pen, trying it at
least half a dozen times upon a sheet of note-paper.
Then the ink did not run as freely as it should, and
further protracted operations of a cleansing and refilling
nature were necessary. Next a book on
which to rest the picture and a blotting-pad had to
be found and placed in position. Then, after further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
and repeated trial-trips of his pen upon the harbour
waters of a sheet of note-paper, he launched his craft
upon the big seas and settled down seriously to the
business of signing the photograph. Had it been a
death-warrant or a cheque for £100,000 to which he
was momentously affixing a signature, he could
not have gone to work more carefully. In a round,
neat, clerkly hand he slowly and laboriously penned
his name “Edward Whymper” with the date beneath
the portrait&mdash;and the deed was done.</p>

<p>I have described thus lengthily the slow and
methodical way in which he set about signing this
photograph for the reason that, trivial as the incident
may seem, it is illustrative of the character and
methods of the man. He walked slowly, thought
slowly, worked slowly, and talked slowly, not
because of any sluggishness of brain or body, but
because every word, every action, was calculated
and deliberate. It was because he was so slow that
he was so sure. Just as in mountaineering he never
moved a step until he was certain of the foothold
in front of him, so in conversation he never spoke
before he thought.</p>

<p>Artist as he originally was by profession, lecturer
and mountaineer as, either by chance or by circumstance,
he afterwards became, by temperament he
was essentially a man of science; and even in casual
conversation he hated what was slipshod, random,
or inexact. He was an admirable listener to anyone
who was speaking from knowledge; and I have
often admired the courtly, if somewhat stately,
attention he would accord to those who spoke, and
with authority upon some subject on which Whymper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
himself was not an expert. But when the conversation
was mainly in his hands, he liked to feel
that he was chairman as well as principal speaker
at the meeting, and would never allow the talk to
run off at a tangent. If his companion ventured
an opinion upon some side issue which the conversation
had suggested, Whymper would pull him up
magisterially by interposing, “You were saying
just now that you thought so and so. We will, if
you please, confine ourselves to that side of the
matter before opening up another.” Courteously
as he phrased it, his “if you please” was peremptory
rather than persuasive, and so in a sense was merely
formally polite.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Of all the men I have ever known, none so habitually
refrained from talking shop as Whymper.
Hence of Whymper the mountaineer&mdash;and mountaineering
was in a sense with him a profession&mdash;as
well as of Whymper the artist and the lecturer, I
have nothing of interest to say. One reason perhaps
is that of mountaineering I know comparatively
nothing and of art even less. Of Whymper the
lecturer I am more competent to speak, as for ten
years I was his fellow lecturer, constantly either
preceding or following him upon the same platform
all over the country. We were both in the hands of
the same agent, I might say the only agent, for Mr.
Gerald Christy may be said to control the lecture
field and practically to be without a rival. Hence
as a fellow Christy minstrel (as Mr. Christy’s lecturers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
musicians and entertainers are sometimes
called) Whymper and I might be supposed occasionally
to compare notes. But though he was interested
to hear of my lecturing experiences he rarely spoke
of his own.</p>

<p>Of one provincial platform and Press experience,
however, he was incontinently communicative and
explosive. He lectured for a Young Men’s Society
(not the Y.M.C.A. as was stated in some subsequent
Press notices) at the Claughton Music Hall, Birkenhead.
At either side of the platform was a door
leading into a small room for the use of artistes. In
the room on the right a cheerful fire had been
hospitably lit, by order of the committee, the unoccupied
room on the left being without a fire and
in total darkness. Between these two rooms and
leading out of each, was a flight of stairs, meeting
in the centre and then continuing in one flight
down to the ground floor of the building, where was
a back exit. Whymper, who was given to “exploring”
on a small scale, as well as a vast one, must
needs find out what was in the unlighted room as
well as in the lighted and fire-warmed room which
had been placed at his disposal. (“Please bear in
mind,” the secretary of the society subsequently
wrote to me, “that he had no business to be poking
into the place at all.”)</p>

<p>Having examined, so far as he could in the dark,
the unoccupied room, Whymper then opened the
door leading out to the stairs, the flare of the fire on
the opposite side throwing into shadow the staircase
which lay between the two rooms. Thinking
that there was a level passage from one room to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
other, he made to walk along it, and fell head first
down the stairs, severely injuring his shoulder. So
severe indeed was the injury, that the lecture had
to be abandoned, and Whymper to be taken in a
cab to his hotel and put to bed, where he remained
a week. He was extremely angry and exasperated
with the committee and the secretary, who were in
no way to blame, but his exasperation then was as
nothing to his fury when in a newspaper he read a
notice of the incident. It was headed “One of Life’s
Little Ironies,” and was to the effect that “though
Mr. Whymper, who had made the first ascent of
the Matterhorn when four of his companions had
lost their lives, had probably climbed more dangerous
peaks than any man living or dead, and without any
serious mishap to himself, it was surely one of life’s
little ironies that he should receive his most serious
hurt by falling off a platform while peacefully and
presumably safely addressing a Y.M.C.A. audience
in the provinces.”</p>

<p>In one of Mr. W.&nbsp;W. Jacobs’s delightful books he
tells of a bargee whose language in hospital was so
awful that “they fetched one of the sisters and the
clergyman to hear it.” As an Irishman who dearly
enjoys the spectacle of “wigs on the green,” I could
have wished that the secretary and some of the
committee of the Young Men’s Society in question
could have been present as I was when the
newspaper paragraph quoted first came to Mr.
Whymper’s notice. The secretary humorously
suggests that the fact that Whymper demanded
payment of his doctor’s bill and hotel expenses from
the society, only to be politely told that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
accident was no affair of theirs, probably played
some part in adding to the irritation and explosiveness
with which Whymper read the paragraph and
commentary upon the accident.</p>

<p>One other accident that befell him&mdash;though not
in connection with lecturing&mdash;I may relate. He was,
as every one knows, a keen naturalist as well as an
entomologist, and when returning from Canada
brought with him a squirrel, which in the seclusion
of his cabin he used often to set free that he might
study its ways as he studied the ways of all creatures
whether free or in captivity. Aboard ship he was
less able to indulge his eccentricities in the matter
of unconventional hours for meals and for work
than when on shore, but even there he would often
read or work far into the night, making up for the
consequent loss of sleep by snatching a nap at an
hour when the majority of his fellow passengers were
most wide awake. On one such occasion Whymper
forgot to return the squirrel to its cage; and in
frolicking round the cabin, and leaping from floor
to berth, the little creature, having no fear of its
master, scampered along his prostrate form, and in
passing scratched slightly the sleeper’s face. Apparently
the squirrel had picked up some poisonous
matter in the curve of its sharp claw, which getting
into the scratch poisoned Whymper’s face, so that
for weeks, as he said, he was hideous to behold, and
had, I believe, to cancel certain lecturing engagements.</p>

<p>“All my worse hurts,” he said to me when describing
the incident and waxing warm at the memory
of the lecturing accident, to which I have already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
referred, “came to me from some trivial cause.
When there is real danger ahead, no one is more
careful, more wary, or watchful than I. Luckily
there was no member of the Young Men’s Society
present on this occasion, or the reptilian who sent
paragraphs to the Press: ‘Edward Whymper, the
Great Mountaineer, falls off a lecturing platform
and seriously injures himself,’ would have earned
a scurrilous half-dollar by paragraphing the Press
with an announcement headed, ‘Edward Whymper
badly wounded by a squirrel.’”</p>

<p>I assured him that it was the nimble journalist,
not any member of the Young Men’s Society, who
was responsible for the paragraph in question, but
his wrath at the memory of the incident was not to
be appeased, and, to whatever deserving institutions
he may have left legacies, I do not anticipate that
the Society in question was among them.</p>

<p>Whymper, as I have said, never or rarely talked
shop, but he did talk&mdash;though never egotistically&mdash;of
himself. He told me that he came of a Suffolk
family, but could trace his descent, though he still
had hopes of doing so, no farther back than his great-great-grandfather.
The men of his race rarely
married. When they did marry they were nearly
always the fathers of girls. His brother Frank was,
he told me, Postmaster-General of India. Speaking
of his own extraordinary physical activity and
stamina, he said that he had actually walked the
entire length of the Canadian-Pacific Railway, being
nearly killed once while doing so. I gathered that
he had made more money out of certain businesses
in which he was interested, especially a colour-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>printing
process, than from either lecturing or
books, though his books and guide-book have of
course had a great sale, and early editions of his
mountaineering works fetch high sums among collectors.
Unlike some authors, so far from having
any grievance against publishers, he said that of
Mr. John Murray he could not speak too highly,
and that “going one better,” as he put it, than
Mrs. Bishop, the great traveller&mdash;who left in her will
her copyrights in token of her appreciation and
gratitude to Mr. Murray&mdash;he proposed while
he was alive to make Mr. Murray a present
of the copyright of some of his books. This purpose
he did not, I now understand, carry into effect during
his lifetime, but I believe I am correct in saying that
at his death his copyrights were bequeathed to Mr.
Murray. Speaking of his own career, he said that
not mountaineering, nor exploring, nor authorship
so fascinated him and gratified him as his discoveries
in geology.</p>

<p>One of his geological anecdotes concerned a fossil
forest in Greenland, which, when Whymper heard of
it, he at once set out to explore. There he found a
large fossil cone which he was at great pains to split
into two halves, that he might the better examine
it. It was sent to a certain famous German professor,
an expert of world-wide reputation in fossil
flora, who wrote saying that he attached much importance
to the find, and asked Whymper to come
to see him, which Whymper did. Producing the
split cone, the professor pronounced it a magnolia,
in fact two magnolias and of different species.
“No, no,” said Whymper. “One magnolia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
There can’t be any doubt about that.” “You are
mistaken,” said the professor curtly, annoyed at
being contradicted. “I have put both under the
microscope, and I assert positively that they are
of a different species.” “One,” repeated Whymper.
“Two,” insisted the other. Then Whymper
joined the two halves.</p>

<p>Next to geology Whymper seemed most interested
in aneroids. It was a subject on which he&mdash;by no
means a boastful man&mdash;claimed to be an expert and
on which he purchased every book that was issued.
Especially prized by him were two books on aneroids,
one bought in Rouen, the other in Geneva by a
Monsieur Pascal, whom Whymper said was generally
believed to be the writer Blaise Pascal, but was in
reality only a relative.</p>

<p>Of his mountaineering experiences he said but
little, and never once during the thirteen years that
I knew him did he of his own accord refer to the
historic Matterhorn tragedy. He did, however, tell
me of the circumstances under which he became a
mountaineer.</p>

<p>“It was purely accidental,” he said. “The idea
of climbing had never occurred to me, one reason
being, as you who have done some climbing yourself
will readily appreciate, that it costs money;
and I was then a young fellow with all his
way to make in the world, and was looking out for
a means to make money, not to spend it, and was
in fact rather at my wits’ end to know how to earn
a livelihood. The profession I was supposed to
follow was art, and even thus early my draughtmanship
and woodcut work were, I think I may say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
creditable. Anyhow, more than one person who
was competent to judge thought so, and in fact said
so. It was owing to somebody saying so that I got
the job which led to my becoming a mountaineer.
There was a feeling among climbers that the record
of their work required illustrating. They’re human
like the rest of the world, and some of them fancied
that it would add to the éclat, the importance, and
the heroism of their achievements if they could be
depicted crossing a crevasse that yawned like a blue
hell below them, holding on for dear life and like a
fly to a wall against a perpendicular rock, with a
sheer abyss and drop of a thousand feet beneath
them, or skyed upon some heaven-piercing and
hitherto inaccessible peak that made unclimbing
folk turn sick and giddy to think of.</p>

<p>“You know the sort of thing&mdash;Professor Tyndall
crossing the Great Crevasse, on this or that
mountain, Mr. Leslie Stephen negotiating the
most difficult and dangerous pass on t’other one,
or somebody else setting the British flag on a
hitherto unsurmounted peak. The question was
how to do it and whom to get to do it. To-day
they’d do it by photography; but photography
wasn’t then what it is now, and it was evident
that their man would have to be a capable
draughtsman, and that he’d have to be a man of
nerve, stamina and power of endurance, as he also
would have to do some climbing. Well, to cut a
long story short, some one who had chanced to
see my work in art and to think well of it, suggested
me as a likely man. I was glad of a job and jumped
at it, but once having started climbing, as I necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
had to, in six months I had climbed peaks
that no one else had ever attempted; and that is
the history in brief, if not the whole story, of how I
became a climber.”</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Edward Whymper was a man of few friends, I had
almost written of no friends, for though he was upon
what, in the case of another man, would be described
as terms of friendship with many of the world’s most
distinguished workers, and though he enjoyed their
company and their intercourse as they enjoyed his,
I should describe the bond which held him and them
together as “liking” and interest in each other and
in each other’s achievements rather than as friendship
in the closer sense of the word. The mould
into which he was cast was austere, stern, and
could be forbidding. He was a “marked” man
wherever he went; and in all companies a man of
masterful personality, who inspired attention and
respect in every one, and something like fear in a
few, but who, except in the case of children, rarely
inspired affection. That he was aware his manner
was not always conciliatory&mdash;was in fact at times
forbidding&mdash;seems likely from a story which I have
heard him tell on several occasions and always with
infinite gusto.</p>

<p>“I was walking up Fleet Street one day,”
he began, pursing his lips, mouthing and almost
smacking them over his words as if the flavour
were pleasant to the palate, “when I chanced
to see a sixpence lying upon the ground. Now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
according to the law of the land, anything we find
in the street is in a public place and must be taken
to the nearest police station. I wasn’t going to be
at the bother of picking up a sixpence merely to
take myself and it to the police station, so I cast an
eye around and walking just behind me I saw a poor
ragged devil without so much as a shirt to his back
or a pair of shoes to his feet. I didn’t require to
speak or even to point to the sixpence. I just caught
the fellow’s eyes and looked with my own two eyes
at the sixpence upon the pavement. That was
quite enough. He followed my glance, saw the coin
lying there, knew that my glance meant ‘You can
have it if you like,’ and my good fellow was down
on it in a moment. Well, I didn’t stop to let the
fellow thank me, but just walked on. It so happens,
however, that I’m peculiarly sensitive to outside
impressions. If I’m in the street and some one is
taking stock of me, even though I can’t see them,
I’m conscious of it in a moment. If I’m in a hall,
listening, say, to a lecture, and some one behind me
has recognised me, or is interested in me for any
reason, I’m just as aware of it as if I had eyes in the
back of my head. Well, I passed up Fleet Street,
and along the Strand till, approaching Charing
Cross, I became suddenly aware that some one
behind was watching me as if for a purpose. I
turned, and there was my ragged, shirtless, bootless
devil of a tramp, who had followed me all that way,
poor devil, I supposed to thank me. So I thought
it decent to slow my pace, and when he was just
alongside of me I half turned to give him the chance
to speak, and waited to hear what he had to say.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
What do you think it was? To express his thanks?
Not a bit. When he was level with me, he hissed,
almost spat in my ear, ‘You blank, blank, blankey
blank, blank! too blanky proud blank, are you? to
pick up a sixpence&mdash;blank you!’</p>

<p>“That, I said to myself at the time,” continued
Whymper, “is all the thanks you get for trying to
do a good turn to the British vagrant. But, on
thinking it over, I’ve come to the conclusion that
there was something unintentionally offensive or
shall we say patronising, in the way I looked at the
man and then at the sixpence&mdash;something which he
resented so bitterly that he had to follow me all that
way to spit it out.”</p>

<p>Another incident, which amused him at the time,
happened when he and I had walked out from
Southend to Shoeburyness, a distance of some four
miles. It was on a Sunday morning, and when we
arrived at Shoeburyness he remarked:</p>

<p>“I had some very salt bloaters for breakfast.
Do you mind if, Sunday morning as it is, I call at
the first inn to slake my thirst?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” I replied.</p>

<p>As it was within the prohibited hours when inns
are closed except to <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> travellers&mdash;by which is
meant those who have travelled three miles from
the place where they slept the previous night&mdash;we
found the inn door closed. Whymper knocked
sharply and loudly at it in his usual masterful way,
and, when it was opened by a frowsy looking fellow
in shirt sleeves, said dryly, in more senses than
one:</p>

<p>“I am thirsty and want a drink, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
“Are you <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> travellers?” inquired the
fellow.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Whymper partly to the fellow
and partly to me, “there was a time early in my
career when some doubts were cast upon my qualifications
as a mountaineer and even, upon my word,
in regard to my statement as to what had happened,
but, this is the first time I have been challenged in
regard to my being a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> traveller. I’ll say
nothing about the qualification of my friend here,
but considering that since the last time I passed this
hostelry I have travelled some seven or eight
thousand miles, I think I’m entitled to describe myself
as a traveller in a very <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> sense. As a
matter of fact, we have come from Southend this
morning, which I believe is outside the statutory
three miles. Do I look, my good fellow, like a man
who’d tell you a lie about a thing like that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the man looking Whymper
very hard in the face, “but I’ll tell you what
you do look like if you wish. You look to me like
a man who if he’d made up his mind to have a drink
would have it whether he was a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> traveller
or not, and wouldn’t let no one else stop him from
having it, and that’s more.”</p>

<p>“I observe, my man,” said Whymper sententiously,
as the door was opened to admit us, “that
you are no indifferent judge of character, but I am
curious also to know whether you are disposed to
have a drink yourself.”</p>

<p>The man’s answer, in Parliamentary parlance,
was in the affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>At what I am now about to say of Edward
Whymper, he would himself either have hooted with
cynical ridicule or else would have heard with a
slow and cold smile of amused scorn, but to me his
was a sad, gloomy, if not indeed a pathetic figure.
I do not say this because he was a lonely man&mdash;and
in all life I have met no one who was quite as lonely
as he&mdash;but because he walked always in the shadow
of self. I am not implying that he was selfish, for he
was not. In his business transactions&mdash;albeit not
an easy man to “best,” and not above driving a
hard bargain with those whom he distrusted&mdash;he
was not only as good as his word, but was the soul
of integrity and honour. Prepared as he was to
fulfil his share of the contract to the letter, he expected
and required that others should do the same.
Yet when dealing with those who had treated him
handsomely he could be quixotically generous.
Even to those to whom he owed nothing, he did
many unselfish kindnesses for which he expected no
gratitude, and was prepared to go unrequited.
While the professional mendicant was sternly and
mercilessly shown the door, the deserving poor he
was always, if stealthily and secretly, ready to help.</p>

<p>Yet, looking back on him as I knew him all those
years, I ask myself whether there was really one
being in the world who really “mattered” to
Edward Whymper, or by whose death his serenity
would have been disturbed. It was Robert Montgomery,
I believe, who wrote a poem in which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
pictured the tragic loneliness of “the last man”
left alone in the world.</p>

<p>Had it been possible, by some such universal
cataclysm as, say, a world-wide earthquake, for every
living creature, with one exception, to perish off
the face of the earth, and had Edward Whymper
been that one exception, I verily believe that, whistling
softly to himself at the wonder of it all, he would,
with untrembling fingers, calmly have filled and lit
his pipe, and have sat down, were anything left to
sit upon, to contemplate the ruins of a world,
and then, first of all, to consider how to get his next
meal, and, after that, to think out how to accommodate
himself to the unusual and inconvenient
circumstances in which he found himself. Nor
would he have forgotten, with such instruments as
happened to be within reach, to take such astronomical
and meteorological bearings as he thought
would prove valuable in the interests of science.</p>

<p>It is of course preposterous and inconceivable to
suppose any such situation as I have imagined, and
some of my readers may reasonably suppose that I
am either laughing at them or wishing them to
laugh at Whymper or myself. I assure them I am
doing nothing of the sort, for, with no inconsiderable
knowledge of the man, I honestly believe that in
such circumstances he would have behaved exactly
as I have said. They are magnificent, those qualities
of absolute self-dependence, self-containment and
self-contentment which Whymper possessed, but
to me at least and at times they seemed almost superhuman.
He walked, as I have said, in the shadow
of self; was content so to walk, and apparently had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
no conception of and no wish to live a life to the
happiness or sorrow of which it was in the power of
others to contribute. A man who can so isolate
himself is possibly to be envied, even if it never
occurred to him that he is also to be pitied. Yet in
spite of the fact that he was perfectly satisfied with
his lot in life, and in living that life according to the
cut-and-dried system by which he ordered it, and
in spite, too, of the fact that he would have assured
one that he was, and indeed believed himself to be, a
happy man, Edward Whymper was, as I have
said, not only the loneliest but the most pathetic
human creature I have ever known.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Whymper’s comments upon his contemporaries
and their work were always exceedingly penetrative.
Of some he spoke very generously but never effusively,
of others critically and of a few sarcastically.
I well remember the cynical smile with which he
called my attention to an inscription in a presentation
volume. It had been sent to him by a well-known
writer, of whom I say no more than that he
had once held a very distinguished position in the
Society of Authors. The inscription ran: “To
Edward Whymper, Esq. with the author’s complements,”
and as I write, I seem to see Whymper’s
squarish finger stubbed under the guilty “e” in
compliments. No one did he seem to hold in greater
respect and regard than Mr. Edward Clodd, of
whom he once spoke to me as “not only a profound
thinker and scholar and brilliant writer, but a loyal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and true friend and the intimate associate of many
of the great men of our time.” I remember once
inviting Whymper to be my guest at a dinner in
town, and mentioning that Clodd was to be of the
party.</p>

<p>“You know,” said he, “how generally I hum and
ha when anyone asks me to a function or a dinner,
and that I’d rather at any time dine on bread and
cheese and in pyjamas (which he often wore in the
house) here in Southend than be at the trouble of
getting into a black coat and journeying up to
London to eat a ten-course dinner. But, if Clodd
is to be one of your guests, I’m your man.”</p>

<p>I had only three guests, Whymper, Mr. Clodd, and
Mr. Warwick Deeping, and the two older men who
had not met for a very long time had so much to say
about celebrities who were the friends of both, and
of historic former meetings, that Deeping (always
a silent man by choice) and myself (host though I
was) were content for the most part to listen. Apart
from his wish to see an old friend whom he held in
great respect, Whymper had, if I am not mistaken,
another and more personal reason for accepting my
invitation to meet Clodd at dinner, which is why I
refer to that otherwise unimportant function.</p>

<p>And this brings me to a somewhat painful incident
of which, when Whymper was alive, I was occasionally
reminded, always to his disparagement, by
literary friends. If I touch briefly upon it here, it
is not because I wish to rake up an old story, which,
inasmuch as it concerns two distinguished men who
are both dead, might very well be forgotten, but
because since Whymper’s death it has again been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
going the rounds, and because I have an explanation
to put forward in regard to what happened.</p>

<p>Whymper was on a certain occasion&mdash;it is no use
mincing matters&mdash;unpardonably rude to one whom
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once described to me as
“the most modest, the most unassuming, and at
the same time the most learned man I have ever
known”&mdash;the late Grant Allen. It was my privilege
to know and to be the guest of Grant Allen in his
home, and I am of opinion that he was not only the
most modest, most unassuming, and most learned,
but also the gentlest, most generous, and most
lovable of men. Meeting Whymper at a dinner&mdash;I
was not present, but in common, I expect, with some
of my readers I have heard the story often&mdash;Allen
quite innocently, and never dreaming that the
question could give offence, asked Whymper concerning
the historic accident on the Matterhorn, to
be told curtly that the accident was his own
business, and he did not choose to discuss it.</p>

<p>Unpardonably rude, as I have said, as such a reply
was, and to such a man as Allen, that rudeness is,
I fancy, capable of explanation. To those who
knew Whymper only slightly and&mdash;overlooking the
sensitive breathing nostrils, so wide and circular at
the opening&mdash;saw only the cold hardness of his face
and eyes, the rat-trap-like snap of mouth and jaw,
he seemed a man of iron; and this impression the
story of his indomitable courage, his dogged determination
to succeed where others had failed, went
far to confirm. That such a man, a man rough-hewn
as he seemed out of block granite, and with
sinews of steel, could be cognisant of the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
he had “nerves,” much less could suffer from them,
would occur to no one. None the less, I happen
to know that the shock of that tragedy in early life
among the Alps, when, powerless to help them, he
had to stand inactively by and see his companions
hurled to certain death, left its mark upon him to
the end of his life, and was sometimes re-enacted in
his dreams. In his later years, when his iron constitution
began to weaken and when his nerves were
less steady than of old, any sudden reference to that
early tragedy would, in his more irritable moments,
annoy and anger him, and I am convinced that it
was in such conditions his rude and surly rebuff to
Grant Allen was spoken. That Whymper afterwards
regretted it I have reason to know. I
believe that it was because Clodd was the close and
devoted friend of Allen, and had, moreover, been
present when the rebuff was administered, and had
been pained by it, that Whymper was anxious to
meet Clodd, either for the reason that&mdash;indifferent
as he generally was to what others thought of him&mdash;he
was for once anxious to efface any bad impression
that the incident had created, or because he hoped
to have some opportunity of speaking of Allen (he
was too proud a man to have written to Allen direct)
in such a way as to mend matters.</p>

<p>That this is not mere surmise on my part I am
convinced from what I have myself heard Whymper
say and from the way he afterwards spoke of Allen.
He was, as I say, a proud man, a taciturn man, and
sometimes a rude man, but at heart he was just; and
unnecessarily and undeservedly to have given pain
to another troubled him as much, if not more, than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
anything <em>could</em> trouble one whom few things outside
himself could affect.</p>

<p>Since writing the above I ventured to submit a
draft of this paper to my friend Mr. Clodd, whose
very interesting reply I have permission to quote
as written:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I read the enclosed last night. Like Cromwell,
Whymper would say, “Paint me, warts and
wrinkles and all,” and you have done as he would
have wished, producing a faithful and withal sympathetic
portrait.</p>

<p>I have just queried an obscure sentence here and
there, but have not touched the punctuation, which
I presume has had your attention in the original.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether the Tennyson story has
appeared in print. Edmund Gosse told it to me
years back. Of course the son wouldn’t admit anything
conveying an idea of his father’s gruffness.
When I referred to the <cite>Life</cite> as a Biography, Meredith
said to me, “Don’t call it that: ’tis only a
Eulogy.” What I now remember about the Allen
rebuff is that Whymper had been lecturing in
various places, and that Allen&mdash;who was thinking
of making money that way&mdash;asked him about his
fees. And this Whymper wouldn’t tell him. On the
same occasion, Hardy being of the company, Whymper
narrated in detail the Matterhorn catastrophe,
which gave Hardy the impetus to a sonnet. Whymper
was the only man Hardy ever expressed the
desire to meet again&mdash;hence their coming to me in
the Easter of 1910.</p>

<p>You truly assess him as a lonely man, but there
was a soft place under a hard shell, and this comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
out in the tenderness towards children and all helpless
things of which you speak. I am glad to have
your witness to his liking for me. His visits to me
remain a cherished memory.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Edward Clodd</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I was under the impression, before receiving Mr.
Clodd’s very interesting letter, and from what Grant
Allen told me of the rebuff, that it was the latter’s
question about the Matterhorn which caused the
trouble. But the incident happened under Mr.
Clodd’s roof, and his memory is not likely to fail
him. Possibly Allen had already annoyed Whymper
by asking to be told the story of the Matterhorn,
and the inquiry about lecture fees following
upon that provoked Whymper’s ready wrath. That
he should thereafter voluntarily have described the
ice accident to Mr. Thomas Hardy (at mention of
whose honoured name I stand respectfully at salute)
in no way surprises me, and in fact confirms what I
have said in an earlier section of this paper to the
effect that “the advance must always come from
Whymper himself,” that he was not indisposed to
talk when left to himself, but was quick to suspect
any appearance of being “exploited” or “drawn.”
That he resented having questions about the Matterhorn
catastrophe suddenly sprung upon him I have
reason to know, for I have more than once heard
him snub, almost savagely, a tactless inquirer.
Allen’s question about fees (he was the last man in
the world to be impertinent) may seem to some
readers unwarrantable, but none of us in Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Christy’s list made any secret of the matter, as
Allen&mdash;himself a lecturer, but not for Mr. Christy&mdash;was
aware. On the contrary, Whymper asked
me, soon after I first met him, what fees I received,
telling me in return what his own handsome payments
were.</p>

<p>There we will leave the comparatively trivial
incident of his rudeness to Allen. I should not have
written thus lengthily of it, but for the receipt of
Mr. Clodd’s letter, and because my picture of
Whymper depends, for any faithfulness it has, not
upon bold strokes of the brush, but upon the slow
and careful painting in of comparatively unimportant
but none the less cumulative details.</p>

<p>Edward Whymper was a man whom it was easy
to misjudge, and was so misjudged of many if only
for the reason that he would go out of his way to
flatter, to please, or to pay court to none, or to be
other than his natural self to all those with whom
he was brought into contact. Rank and title, great
social position, the power of the purse and the power
of the Press, nor his own self-interests, could ever
move Edward Whymper to seek the favour of those
who for their own sake, or for the sake of what they
have done, he did not already respect. Secure in
the knowledge of his own just and honourable dealings
with all men, and seeking only the approval of
his conscience, he was content to go his own way in
the world, a strange, strong, lonely, but in many
respects a remarkable man&mdash;I think in force of
character and determination the most remarkable
man I have ever known. To me, as to many others
of whom I am aware, he did many kindnesses and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
showed constant friendliness, and if in the opinion
of my readers I seem but ill to have requited these
kindnesses and that friendliness, by drawing a
faithful rather than a flattering picture of the
man as I knew him, it is because he was too sincere,
too honest, too genuine, too fearless to wish it
otherwise. Let me, however, in concluding this
sketch, give one more picture of him as I often saw
him&mdash;a picture which I have purposely kept to the
last for the reason that it shows him in a light
which is probably all unknown to those who did not
see him in his home and in his daily life, and
because it is a memory of him upon which I like to
linger.</p>

<p>Born bachelor as he always seemed to me&mdash;I left
Westcliff shortly before his marriage, and did not
know him and cannot imagine him as a married
man&mdash;he was extremely fond of and invariably kind
to children. With children he was another being,
and, grim as he could be to grown-ups, children invariably
liked and trusted him. My earliest experience
of this was on the evening after my first
supper with him. He had been to town, and, as I
was walking towards the station to purchase an
evening paper, I saw him stalking in front of me,
arrayed in a black greatcoat and top hat and black
leather leggings. In one hand he carried his bag,
and by the other he clasped the hand of a tiny girl-child,
poorly clad and hatless, whom he stooped to
comfort as tenderly as could any woman, and in
fact took out his own handkerchief to wipe away
her tears. The little mite, who hailed from East
London, had been sent by some charitable person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
for a week by the sea to one of the many Holiday
Homes for the Poor in Southend. How she had become
lost I do not remember, but lost she certainly
was, learning which Whymper had comforted,
quieted, and coaxed her into telling him where her
temporary home was, and when I met him he was on
his way to take her there. My own stepson, then a
lad of twelve and a cadet on H.M.S. <i>Worcester</i>, was
devoted to him, being especially proud that the
greatest of mountaineers was at the trouble of giving
him lessons in climbing. Up and down the cliff
slopes of Southend, Whymper marched the lad,
impressing upon him the importance of always
going at one steady and uniform rate, never, except
under exceptional circumstances when haste was
absolutely necessary, forcing the pace or indulging
in sprinting; teaching him to walk from the hips
mechanically and machine wise, so that no strain
was put upon the heart and lungs, and instructing
him in the control and use of the breath. When
after the holiday the boy went back to the <i>Worcester</i>,
he sent Whymper his autograph book, asking
him to inscribe his name therein. In it, the
man whom some people thought grim, surly, and
morose, wrote: “I have been dying to see you
again. When <em>are</em> you coming along? Edward
Whymper. Feb. 24, 1905.”</p>

<p>The boy whom Whymper always spoke of as his
“friend” is at this moment serving his King and
country in France as a soldier, throwing up his post
in Canada directly war was declared. He is too
young to feel&mdash;as some of us who are young no
longer now, alas, feel, as has been said, that old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
friends are the best, and it is to the grave we must
go to find them; but he is only one of many to
whom, when they were children, the dead man
showed constant kindness, and who will to their
life’s end hold the name of the great mountaineer,
who was also a true child-lover, in honour, gratitude,
and affection.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_189">OSCAR WILDE</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“To</span> the memory of one who by some strange
madness, beyond understanding, made
shipwreck of his own life and of the life
of others; one of whom the world speaks in
whispers, but of whom I say openly that I never
heard an objectionable word from his lips and saw
in him at no time anything more vicious than
vanity; to the memory of</p>

<p class="center larger">
<span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>,
</p>

<p class="in0">actor (in a great life tragedy as in everything else),
artist (in more crafts than one, including flattery),
poet, critic, convict, genius, and, as I knew him,
gentleman: I dedicate these pages in memory of
many kindnesses.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In these words I wished, soon after Wilde’s
death, to dedicate a book, but the publisher of the
book in question was obdurate. He would not, he
said, have Wilde’s name on the dedication page of
any work issued by him, and went so far as to urge
me not to fulfil the intention I had even then formed
of one day writing a chapter on Oscar Wilde as I
knew him. Yet in Oscar Wilde as I knew him, as
stated in the above dedication, except for his vanity
there was no offence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
The preface, since my relations with the publisher
of whom I speak were pleasant and friendly, I withdrew.
If I have let sixteen years elapse before
writing the chapter, it was for no other reason than
that I felt the thing could wait&mdash;would perhaps be
the better for waiting&mdash;and that the pressure of
other work kept me employed.</p>

<p>But one day a man, who to my knowledge has
eaten Wilde’s salt and received many kindnesses
from him in the season of Wilde’s prosperity, called
to see me concerning some literary project. On my
shelves are books given and inscribed to me by
Wilde and signed “from his sincere friend,” and on
my mantelshelf stands a portrait similarly inscribed
and signed. Seeing this portrait, my caller observed:</p>

<p>“If I were you I should put that thing out of sight,
and, if you happen at any time to hear his name
mentioned, I should keep the fact that he had been
a friend of yours to yourself.”</p>

<p>That decided me to write my long delayed chapter.
I begin by a protest. In his very interesting <cite>Notes
from a Painter’s Life</cite>, my friend Mr. C.&nbsp;E. Hallé
speaks of Wilde’s “repulsive appearance.” At the
time of Wilde’s conviction some of the sketches of
him, presumably made in court and published in
certain prints, did so portray him, possibly because,
as he was just then being held up to public execration,
so to picture him fitted in with the popular
conception. Mr. Hallé wrote “after the event” of
Wilde’s downfall, when it is easy not only to be wise,
but also to see in the outer man some signs of the
evil within. But from the statement that Wilde’s
appearance was “repulsive” I entirely dissent. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
is true there was a flabby fleshiness of face and neck,
a bulkiness of body, an animality about the large
and pursy lips&mdash;which did not close naturally, but
in a hard, indrawn and archless line&mdash;that suggested
self-indulgence, but did not to me suggest vice.
Otherwise, except for this fleshiness and for the
animality of the mouth, I saw no evil in Wilde’s face.
The forehead, what was visible of it&mdash;for he disposed
brown locks of his thick and carefully parted hair
over either temple&mdash;was high and finely formed. The
nose was well shaped, the nostrils close and narrow&mdash;not
open and “breathing” as generally seen in
highly sensitive men. The eyes were peculiar, the
almond-shaped lids being minutely out of alignment.
I mean by this that the lids were so cut and the eyes
so set in the head that the outer corners of the lids
drooped downwards very slightly and towards the
ears, as seen sometimes in Orientals. Liquid, soft,
large and smiling, Wilde’s eyes, if they seemed to
see all things&mdash;life, death, other mortals and most
of all himself&mdash;half banteringly, met one’s own eyes
frankly. His smile seemed to me to come from his
eyes, not from his lips, which he tightened rather
than relaxed in laughter. His general expression&mdash;always
excepting the mouth, which, its animality
notwithstanding, had none of the cruelty which goes
so often with sensuality&mdash;was kindly.</p>

<p>The best portrait I have seen of Wilde is one in
my possession which has never been published.
It was taken when he was the guest of the late Lady
Palmer (then Mrs. Walter Palmer), with whom I had
at the time some acquaintance. She was a close
friend of Wilde (who christened her “Moonbeam”)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
and of George Meredith (whom she sometimes half-seriously,
half-playfully spoke of as “The Master”).
In the portrait, Lady Palmer is seated with Meredith,
Mrs. Jopling Rowe being seated on her right and Mr.
H.&nbsp;B. Irving on her left. Behind Meredith’s chair
stands Wilde with Miss Meredith (afterwards Mrs.
Julian Sturgis), Sir J. Forbes-Robertson, and I
think Mr. David Bisham on his right. The portrait
of Wilde, if grave, is frank, untroubled, and attractive,
for, when he chose to be serious, the large lines
of his face and features sobered into a repose and
into a massiveness which were not without dignity.
Too often, however, Dignity suddenly let fall her
cloak, and Vanity, naked and unashamed, was revealed
in her place.</p>

<p>Yet there is this to be said of Wilde’s vanity, that
its very nakedness was its best excuse. A loin-cloth,
a fig-leaf would have offended, but it was so artlessly
naked that one merely smiled and passed on.
Moreover, it was never a jealous or a malicious
vanity. It was so occupied in admiring itself in the
mirror that the smile on its face was never distorted
into a scowl at sight of another’s success. Wilde’s
vanity, I repeat, was as entirely free from venom
as was his wit. No one’s comments on society, on
the men and women he met, the authors he read,
were more incisive or more caustic, but I remember
none in which the thought was slanderous or the
intention spiteful.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A propos</i> of Wilde’s vanity, here is a story told
me long ago by Lieutenant-Colonel Spencer, who
then held a post of some sort in connection with the
Masters in Lunacy. Visiting the Zoological Gardens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
one day&mdash;in his private capacity, I assume, not in
connection with the Lunacy Commission&mdash;he
entered the Monkey House. Within the big cement
wire enclosure a certain liveliness&mdash;the war phrase
seems to have come to stay&mdash;was evident. What it
was all about Colonel Spencer did not know, but
with one exception the occupants were very excited,
leaping wildly from end to end of the cage, and from
top to bottom, jabbering, groaning, snarling, emitting
shrill shrieks of terror or hoarse howls of rage.</p>

<p>The one exception was an evil-looking and elderly
monkey which sat humped and brooding in a corner,
absolutely motionless except for the twitching of
his nostrils and the angry way in which he switched
his eyes first upon what he apparently thought to
be the staring human idiots outside, and then at
the capering and noisy monkey imbeciles within.
“What’s the matter with that monkey?” Colonel
Spencer inquired of a keeper. “Is he ill? He
seems too bored even to scratch.” The keeper
shook his head. “No, he isn’t ill, sir,” he answered.
“Wot’s the matter with ’im, sir? Why, wanity.”
Then stirring up the sulking monkey with his cane,
he added, “’Ere, get up&mdash;Hoscar Wilde!”</p>

<p>One day it was Wilde’s caprice to amuse himself by
talking the most blatantly insincere nonsense,
directed against my own political views, and deliberately
intended to “draw” me. He was in his most
exasperating mood, exuding, or affecting to exude,
egotism at every pore, and fondling, or making pretence
to fondle, his vanity as some spinsters fondle
a favourite cat. At last I could stand it no longer,
and wickedly told him the story of Colonel Spencer’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
visit to the Monkey House at the Zoo and the
keeper’s comment about the sulky monkey. “Wot’s
the matter with ’im, sir? Why, wanity. ’Ere, get
up&mdash;Hoscar Wilde.”</p>

<p>So far from being annoyed, Wilde simply rocked,
or affected to rock with delight.</p>

<p>“I hoped once,” he said, “to live to see a new
shape in chrysanthemums or sunflowers, or possibly
a new colour in roses, blue for choice, called after
me. But that one’s name should percolate even to
the Zoological Gardens, that it should come naturally
to the lips of a keeper in the Monkey House, is fame
indeed. Do remind me to tell George Alexander the
story. It will make him so dreadfully jealous.”</p>

<p>And I answered grimly:</p>

<p>“Your game, Wilde!”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>My friendship with Wilde was literary in its beginnings.
Flattered vanity on my part possibly
contributed not a little to it, for when I was a young
and&mdash;if that be possible&mdash;a more obscure man even
than I am now, Wilde, already famous, was one of
the very first to speak an encouraging word. Here
is the first letter I received from him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">16 Tite Street, Chelsea.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">If you have nothing to do on Wednesday,
will you come and dine at the Hotel de Florence,
Rupert Street, at 7.45&mdash;morning dress, and chianti
yellow or red!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
I am charmed to see your book is having so great
a success. It is strong and fine and true. Your
next book will be a great book.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter, it will be observed, is undated. Apparently
Wilde never dated his letters, for of all the
letters of his which I have preserved not a solitary
one bears a date, other perhaps than the name of the
day of the week on which it was written, and that
only rarely. He had the impudence once at a dinner-party,
when taken to task by a great lady for not
having answered a letter, to reply:</p>

<p>“But, my dear lady, I never answer or write
letters. Ask my friend there, whose faithful correspondent
I am.” Then turning to me, he said, “Tell
Lady &mdash;&mdash; when you heard from me last.”</p>

<p>As I had heard from him that morning, I dissembled
by saying:</p>

<p>“How can I answer that, Wilde, for among my
other discoveries of the eccentricities of genius I
have discovered that genius, at least as represented
by you, never dates its letters. I never had one
from you that was dated.”</p>

<p>Not long after the receipt of this first letter, I proposed
to write what I may call a “grown-up fairy
story,” and asked Wilde whether I might borrow as
sub-title a phrase I had once heard him use of a fairy
tale of his own making&mdash;“A Story for Children from
Eight to Eighty.” He replied as follows, then, as
always, with a capital <em>D</em> for “dear”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap"><span class="l2">16 Tite Street,</span><br />
Chelsea, S.W.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I am only too pleased that any little phrase
of mine will find a place in any title you may give
to any story. Use it, of course. I am sure your
story will be delightful. Hoping to see you soon.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Your friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>My story written and published, I despatched it
cap in hand to carry my acknowledgments to the
teller of supremely lovely fairy stories&mdash;imagined,
not invented&mdash;from whom my own drab and homespun-clad
little tale had impudently “lifted” a
beautiful sub-title to wear, a borrowed plume, in its
otherwise undecorated hat.</p>

<p>Here is Wilde’s very characteristic reply. It
needs no signature to indicate the writer. No other
author of the day would have written thus graciously
and thus generously:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap"><span class="l2">16 Tite Street,</span><br />
Chelsea, S.W.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I should have thanked you long ago for sending
me your charming Fairy Tale, but the season
with its red roses of pleasure has absorbed me quite
and I have almost forgotten how to write a letter.
However, I know you will forgive me, and I must
tell you how graceful and artistic I think your
story is&mdash;full of delicate imagination, and a symbolism
suggestive of many meanings, not narrowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
down to one moral, but many-sided, as I think
symbolism should be.</p>

<p>But your strength lies not in such graceful winsome
work. You must deal directly with Life&mdash;modern
terrible Life&mdash;wrestle with it, and force it
to yield you its secret. You have the power and
the pen. You know what passion is, what passions
are. You can give them their red raiment and make
them move before us. You can fashion puppets
with bodies of flesh and souls of turmoil, and so you
must sit down and do a great thing.</p>

<p>It is all in you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Your sincere friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>That Wilde was an artist in flattery as well as an
egotist, is not to be denied, but when quite early in our
friendship I was shown by a certain woman poet a
presentation copy of Wilde’s book of poems inscribed
“To a poet and a poem,” and within the next few
weeks saw upon a table in the drawing-room of a
very beautiful and singularly accomplished woman,
the late Rosamund Marriott-Watson (“Graham
Tomson”), who was a friend of Wilde’s and mine, a
fine portrait of himself also inscribed “To a poet
and a poem,” I was not so foolish as to take too
seriously the flattering things he said.</p>

<p>Egotist as Wilde was, his was not the expansive
egotism which, in spreading its wings to invite admiration,
seeks to eclipse and to shut out its fellow
egotists from their own little place in the sun. Most
egotists are eager only for flattery and applause.
Wilde was equally eager, but he was ready for the
time being to forget himself and his eagerness in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
applauding and flattering others. Not many
egotists of my acquaintance, especially literary
egotists, write letters like that I have quoted, in
which there is no word of himself, or of his own work,
but only of his friend.</p>

<p>The last letter I ever received from Wilde is in the
same vein. It is as usual undated, but as the play
to which it refers was his first, <cite>Lady Windermere’s
Fan</cite>, I am, by the assistance of Mr. Stuart Mason’s
admirably compiled <cite>Oscar Wilde Calendar</cite>, enabled
to fix the date as the middle of February, 1892.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap"><span class="l2">Hotel Albemarle,</span><br />
Piccadilly, London.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">Will you come and see my play Thursday
night. I want it to be liked by an artist like you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Yours ever,</span><br />
O. W.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Wilde came to see me, I think, the morning after
the production of the play, or at all events within a
morning or two after, and hugged himself with
delight when, in reply to his question, “Do tell
me what you admired most in the play,” I
said:</p>

<p>“Your impudence! To dare to come before the
footlights in response to enthusiastic calls&mdash;smoking
a cigarette too&mdash;and compliment a British audience
on having the unexpected good taste&mdash;for your
manner said as plainly as it could, ‘Really, my
dear people, I didn’t think you had it in you!’&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>to
appreciate a work of art on its merits! You
are a genius, Wilde, in impudence at least if in
nothing else.”</p>

<p>“And you are a plagiarist as well as a flatterer,”
he replied. “You stole that last remark from a
story you have heard me tell about Richard Le
Gallienne. I’m going to punish you by telling you
the story, for, though you stole part of it, I am sure
you have never heard it. No one ever has heard
the story he steals and calls his own; no one ever
has read&mdash;the odds are that he will swear he has
never heard of&mdash;the book from which he has plagiarised.
Our friend Richard is very beautiful, isn’t
he? Wasn’t it you who told me that Swinburne
described him to you as ‘Shelley with a chin’? I
don’t agree. Swinburne might just as well have
described himself as ‘Shelley without a chin.’ No,
it is the Angel Gabriel in Rossetti’s National Gallery
painting of the Annunciation of which Richard
reminds me. The hair, worn long and fanning out
into a wonderful halo around the head, always reminds
me of Rossetti’s angel. However, my story
is that an American woman, in that terribly crude
way that Americans have, asked Richard, ‘Why do
you wear your hair so long, Mr. Le Gallienne?’
Richard is sometimes brilliant as well as always
beautiful, but on this occasion he could think of
nothing less banal and foolish to say than ‘Perhaps,
dear lady, for advertisement.’ ‘But you, Mr. Le
Gallienne! You who have such genius!’ Richard
blushed and bowed and smiled until the lady added
cruelly&mdash;‘for advertisement!’”</p>

<p>Wilde was quite right in saying I had heard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
story before. It had been told me as happening
to himself in America in the days when he wore his
own hair very long, and I am of opinion that it was
much more likely to have happened to Wilde, who
was both a notoriety hunter and an advertiser, than
to Le Gallienne, who is neither.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">A propos</i> of Wilde’s love of advertising, I once
heard the fact commented upon&mdash;perhaps rudely
and crudely&mdash;to Wilde himself. Just as I was about
to enter the Savage Club in company with a Brother
Savage, who was well known as an admirer of
Dickens, we encountered Wilde, and I invited him
to join us at lunch.</p>

<p>“In the usual way,” he answered, “I should
say that I was charmed, but out of compliment to
our friend here, I will for once condescend to quote
that dreadful and tedious person Dickens and
answer, ‘Barkis is willin’.’ Where are you lunching&mdash;Romano’s?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “the Savage Club.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Savage Club,” said Wilde. “I never
enter the Savage Club. It tires me so. It used to be
gentlemanly Bohemian, but ever since the Prince
of Wales became a member and sometimes dines
there, it is nothing but savagely snobbish. Besides,
the members are all supposed to be professionally
connected with Literature, Science, and Art, and I
abhor professionalism of every sort.”</p>

<p>My Dickens friend, who shares every Savage’s
love for the old club (he told me afterwards, whether
correctly or not I do not know, that Wilde’s aversion
was due to the fact that his brother Willie Wilde
had unsuccessfully put up for membership), was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
annoyed by what Wilde had said both about the
club and about Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>“I can understand your dislike of professionalism&mdash;in
advertisement, Mr. Wilde,” he said bluntly.
“And, since you have condescended to stoop to
quote Dickens, I may add that, in the matter of
advertisement, Barkis as represented by Wilde is
not only willing but more than Mr. Willing the
advertising agent himself. Good morning.”</p>

<p>One other story of Wilde and Le Gallienne occurs
to me. Wilde held Le Gallienne, as I do, in warm
liking as a friend and in genuine admiration as a
poet; but, meeting him one day at a theatre, bowed
gravely and coldly and made as if to pass on. Le
Gallienne stopped to say something, and, noticing
the aloofness of Wilde’s manner, inquired:</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Oscar? Have I offended
you in anything?”</p>

<p>“Not offended so much as very greatly pained
me, Richard,” was the stern reply.</p>

<p>“I pained you! In what way?”</p>

<p>“You have brought out a new book since I saw
you last.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what of it?”</p>

<p>“You have treated me very badly in your book,
Richard.”</p>

<p>“I treated you badly in my book!” protested Le
Gallienne in amazement. “You must be confusing
my book with somebody else’s. My last book was
<cite>The Religion of a Literary Man</cite>. I’m sure you can’t
have read it, or you wouldn’t say I had treated you
badly.”</p>

<p>“That’s the very book; I have read every word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
of it,” persisted Wilde, “and your treatment of me
in that book is infamous and brutal. I couldn’t have
believed it of you, Richard&mdash;such friends as we have
been too!”</p>

<p>“I treated you badly in my <cite>Religion of a Literary
Man</cite>?” said Le Gallienne impatiently. “You must
be dreaming, man. Why, I never so much as mentioned
you in it.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it, Richard,” said Wilde, smilingly.</p>

<p>Here is a recollection of another sort. About the
time when Wilde’s star was culminating, he boarded
a Rhine steamer on the deck of which I was sitting.
The passengers included a number of Americans, one
of whom instantly recognised Wilde, and seating
himself beside the new-comer, inquired:</p>

<p>“Guess, sir, you are the great Mr. Oscar Wilde
about whom every one is talking?”</p>

<p>Smilingly, but not without an assumption of the
bland boredom which he occasionally adopted
toward strangers of whom he was uncertain,
Wilde assented. The other, an elderly man
wearing a white cravat, may or may not at
some time have been connected with a church.
Possibly he was then editing some publication,
religious or otherwise, and in his time may have
done some interviewing, for he plied Wilde with
many curious and even over-curious questions concerning
his movements, views, and projects. The
latter, amused at first, soon tired. His eyes wandered
from his interviewer to scan the faces of the
passengers, and catching sight of me made as if to
rise and join me.</p>

<p>The interviewer, who had not yet done with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
him, and was something of a strategist, cut
off Wilde’s retreat by a forward movement of
himself and the deck-chair, in which he was sitting,
so as to block the way. It was apparently merely
the unconscious hitching of one’s seat a little nearer
to an interesting companion, the better to carry on
the conversation, but it was adroitly followed by a
very flattering remark in the form of a question, and
Wilde relapsed lumpily into his seat to answer. For
the next few minutes I could have imagined myself
watching a game of “living chess.” Wilde, evidently
wearying, wished to move his king, as represented
by himself, across the board and into the square
adjacent to myself, but for every “move” he made
his adversary pushed forward another conversational
“piece” to call a check. At last, shaking his
head in laughing remonstrance, Wilde rose, and the
other, seeing the game was up, did the same.</p>

<p>“It has been a real pleasure and honour to meet
you, sir,” he said. “Guess when I get home and tell
my wife I’ve talked to the great Oscar Wilde she won’t
believe me. If you would just write your autograph
there, I’d take it as a kindness.” He had been
searching his pockets while speaking for a sheet of
paper, but finding none opened his Baedeker where
there was a blank sheet and thrust it into Wilde’s
hand.</p>

<p>The latter, with a suggestion in his manner of the
condescension which is so becoming to greatness,
scrawled his name&mdash;a big terminal Greek “e” tailing
off into space at the end&mdash;in the book, and bowing
a polite, in response to the other’s effusive, farewell,
made straight for a deck-chair next to me, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
plumping himself heavily in it began to talk animatedly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the interviewer was excitedly going
the round of his party to exhibit his trophy.</p>

<p>“Oscar Wilde’s on board, the great æsthete!” he
said. “I’ve had a long talk with him. See, here’s
his own autograph in my Baedeker. There he is,
the big man talking to the one in a grey suit.”</p>

<p>The excitement spread, and soon we had the
entire party standing in a ring, or perhaps I should
say a halo, around the object of their worship, who
though still talking animatedly missed nothing of
it all, and by his beaming face seemed to enjoy his
lionising. I suspect him, in fact, of amusing himself
by playing up to it, for, seeing that some of his
admirers were not only looking, but while doing
their best to appear not to be doing so were also
listening intently, his talk struck me as meant for
them as much as for me. He worked off a witty
saying or two which I had heard before, and just as
I had seen him glance sideways at a big plate-glass
Bond Street shop window to admire his figure or
the cut of his coat, so he stole sideway glances at the
faces around as if to see whether admiration of his
wit was mirrored there.</p>

<p>Then he told stories of celebrities, literary or
otherwise, of whom he spoke intimately, called
some of them, as in the case of Besant and Whistler,
by their Christian names, and so tensely was his
audience holding its breath to listen, that when at
Bingen he rose and said, “I’m getting off here,”
one could almost hear the held breath “ough” out
like a deflating tyre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
No sooner was he gone than the interviewer
seated himself in the deck-chair vacated by Wilde,
and inquired politely:</p>

<p>“Are you a lit-er-ary man, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” I said, “I suppose so, in a way.
That’s how I earn my living.”</p>

<p>“May I ask your name?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I said (meaning thereby “you may
ask, but it does not follow that I shall tell you”).
“I am afraid ‘Brown’ is not a very striking name,
but don’t tell me you have never heard it, for there
is nothing so annoys an author as that.”</p>

<p>He was a kindly man, and made haste to reassure
me.</p>

<p>“I know it well,” he protested. “Yours is not
an uncommon name, I believe, in England. It is less
common in the States. Your Christian name is&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“John,” I submitted modestly.</p>

<p>His brow cleared. “Exactly,” he nodded. “I
know it well.”</p>

<p>Then he seemed uncertain again, and looked
thoughtfully but absently at a castle-crowned hill.
I imagine he was running through and ticking
off as the names occurred to him the list
of all the illustrious John Browns. Possibly he
thought of the author of <cite>Rab and His Friends</cite>, and
decided that I was too young. Possibly of Queen
Victoria’s favourite gillie, who was generally pictured
in kilts, whereas I wore knickerbockers.</p>

<p>“You have published books?” he asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Only in England perhaps?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
“No, they have been issued in America too.”</p>

<p>“Sold?”</p>

<p>“The people who bought them were,” I said.</p>

<p>“Tell me the name of one of your books, please.”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“Can’t. Not allowed.”</p>

<p>“Not allowed? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because,” I answered, rattling off the first
nonsense which came to my head, “I’m a member
of the famous ‘Silence Club,’ the members of which
are known as the W.N.T.S.’s. You have heard of
the club of course, even if you haven’t heard of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I feel sure I have; but I was
never quite sure what it meant. What does
W.N.T.S. stand for?”</p>

<p>“It means ‘We Never Talk Shop.’ An author
who so much as mentions the title of his book
except to his publisher, his bookseller, or an agent
is unconditionally expelled.”</p>

<p>Then I delivered my counter-attack. He had
mentioned to Wilde that he hailed from Boston. It
so happens that at my friend Louise Chandler
Moulton’s receptions I had met nearly every
eminent Boston or even American author, so I put
a few questions to my interviewer which showed an
inner knowledge of Boston and American literary
life and celebrities that seemed positively to startle
him. He was now convinced that I was a celebrity
of world-wide fame, and that such a comet should
come within his own orbit, without his getting to
know as much as the comet’s name, was not to be
endured by a self-respecting journalist. He literally
agonised, as well as perspired, in his unavailing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
efforts to trick, wheedle or implore my obscure
name from me. For one moment I was minded to
tell him my name if only to enjoy the shock of its
unknownness, but I resisted the temptation and,
tiring in my turn as Wilde had tired, I rose and said
that as I was getting off at the next stopping place
I would wish him “Good day.” He did not even
ask for John Brown’s autograph. He even seemed
suddenly in a hurry to get rid of me, the reason for
which I afterwards discovered. He had, I suppose,
heard me tell Wilde that my luggage was on board;
and the last I saw of him was in the boat’s hold,
where he was stooping, pince-nez on nose, over the
up-piled bags, boxes, dressing-cases and trunks,
painfully raking them over, and every moment
hoping to be rewarded by finding mine labelled
“Robert Louis Stevenson,” “Rudyard Kipling,”
“Algernon C. Swinburne” or “Thomas Hardy.”
I trust he found it.</p>

<p>When we were back in town I told Wilde my own
adventure with the interviewer after the former had
left the boat. His comment was:</p>

<p>“It sounds like a terrible serial story that I
once saw in a magazine, each chapter of which
was written by a different hand. ‘The Adventures
of Oscar Wilde, by himself, continued by
Coulson Kernahan.’ How positively dreadful!”</p>

<p>I wonder what Wilde will have to say to me, if
hereafter we should discuss together the brief and
fragmentary continuation of his own story which
in these Recollections I have endeavoured to carry
on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Once when Wilde, a novelist and I were lunching
together, and when Wilde, after declaring that the
wine was so “heavenly” that it should be drunk
kneeling, was discoursing learnedly on the pleasures
of the table&mdash;how the flesh of this or that bird, fish
or beast should be cooked and eaten, with what wine
and with what sauce, the novelist put in:</p>

<p>“If I were to adapt Bunyan, I should say that
you ought to have been christened Os-carnalwise
Wilde instead of plain Oscar.”</p>

<p>“How ridiculous of you to suppose that anyone,
least of all my dear mother, would christen me
‘plain Oscar,’” was the reply. “My name has two
O’s, two F’s and two W’s. A name which is destined
to be in everybody’s mouth must not be too long.
It comes so expensive in the advertisements. When
one is unknown, a number of Christian names are
useful, perhaps needful. As one becomes famous,
one sheds some of them, just as a balloonist, when
rising higher, sheds unnecessary ballast, or as you
will shed your Christian name when raised to the
peerage. I started as Oscar Finghal O’Flahertie
Wills Wilde. All but two of the five names have
already been thrown overboard. Soon I shall discard
another and be known simply as ‘The Wilde’
or ‘The Oscar.’ Which it is to be depends upon one
of my imitators&mdash;that horrid Hall Caine, who used
to be known very properly as Thomas Henry; quite
appropriate names for a man who writes and dresses
as he does. I can’t say which he does worse as I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
never read him, but I have often been made ill by
the way he wears his clothes.</p>

<p>“And, by the by, never say you have ‘adapted’
anything from anyone. Appropriate what is already
yours&mdash;for to publish anything is to make it public
property&mdash;but never adapt, or, if you do, suppress
the fact. It is hardly fair to Bunyan, if you improve
on him, to point out, some hundreds of years after,
how much cleverer you are than he; and it is even
more unfair, if you spoil what he has said, and then
‘hold him accountable.’”</p>

<p>“That, I suppose,” said the novelist drily, “is
why when you said the other day that ‘Whenever
a great man dies, William Sharp and the undertaker
come in together,’ you suppressed the fact that the
same thing had already been said in other words by
W.&nbsp;S. Gilbert.”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said Wilde. “It is not for me publicly
to point out Gilbert’s inferiority. That would be
ungenerous. But no one can blame me, if the fact
is patent to all.”</p>

<p>Mention of Sir W.&nbsp;S. Gilbert prompted the other
to say that a friend of his had occasion to take a cab
at Harrow where the author of <cite>The Bab Ballads</cite>
had built a house. Driving from the station to his
destination, his friend noticed this house, and asked
the cabman who lived there. “I don’t know ’is
name, sir,” said the cabman. “But I do know
(I have driven ’im once or twice) that ’e is sometimes
haffable and sometimes harbitrary. They
do say in the town, sir, that ’e’s wot’s called a
retired ’umorist, whatever that may be.”</p>

<p>From Harrow the conversation shifted to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
neighbouring city of St. Albans, where I was then
living.</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Wilde, turning to
me, “that I want to run down to St. Albans once
again to bathe my fingers in the mediæval twilight
of the grey old Abbey. We two will come to you to-morrow.
You shall meet us at the station, give us
lunch at your rooms&mdash;a cutlet, a flask of red chianti
and a cigarette is all we ask&mdash;and then you shall take
us over the Abbey.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted,” I said, “but do you remember
my meeting you the other day when you
were coming away from the Royal Academy? I
asked you how you were, and you replied, ‘Ill, my
dear fellow, ill and wounded to the soul at the
thought of the hideousness of what in this degenerate
country, and these degenerate days, dares to call
itself Art. Get me some wine quickly, or I’m sure I
shall faint.’ Well, I’m living in bachelor diggings
where it would be highly inconvenient to have dead
or dying artists on hand or lying about. The pictures
on show in my bachelor rooms, like the furniture,
are not of my selection. If you were wounded by
what you saw in the Academy, you would die at
sight of one work of art on my walls. It is a hideous
and vulgar representation of ‘Daniel in the Lions’
Den,’ done in crude chromo, four colours.”</p>

<p>Wilde affected to shudder.</p>

<p>“How awful!” he said. “But I can think of
something more awful even than that.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A poor lion in a den of Daniels,” was his reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A factor in Wilde’s downfall was, I am sometimes
told, evil association, but if so it was a factor on
which I can throw no light, as if evil associates he
had I saw nothing of them.</p>

<p>Louise Chandler Moulton sings of</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This brief delusion that we call our life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all we can accomplish is to die,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and of the many figures in the literary, artistic, and
social world of the day whom I met in Wilde’s
company, some have achieved death, some, knighthood
(Mr. Stephen Phillips once said in my hearing,
he was not sure which was the better&mdash;or the worse),
and some, distinction. Of the remainder, the worst
that could be said against them is that they have
since come a crash financially, as Wilde himself did.
It was only in money matters that I ever had cause
to think Wilde immoral.</p>

<p>In setting down these recollections and impressions
I do not write as one of his intimates. We
were friends, we corresponded, I dined with him and
Mrs. Wilde at 16 Tite Street, and he with me, and
we forgathered now and then at clubs, theatrical
first nights, and literary at homes; but the occasions
on which we met were not very many, all told; nor
did I desire more closely to cultivate him, and for
two reasons. One was that the expensive rate at
which he lived made him impossible as other than a
very occasional companion, and the other was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
“straightness” in money matters is to me one of
the first essentials in the man of whom one makes a
friend. On this point Wilde and I did not see alike.
He laughed at me when I said that, while counting
it no dishonour to be poor, I did count it something
of a dishonour deliberately and self-indulgently to
incur liabilities one might not be able to meet. In
his vocabulary there were few more contemptuous
words than that of “tradesman,” as the following
incident, which I may perhaps be pardoned for interpolating,
will show.</p>

<p>When <cite>The Picture of Dorian Grey</cite> was in the
press, Wilde came in to see me one morning.</p>

<p>“My nerves are all to pieces,” he said, “and I’m
going to Paris for a change. Here are the proofs of my
novel. I have read them very carefully, and I think
all is correct with one exception. Like most Irishmen,
I sometimes write ‘I will be there,’ when it should
be ‘I shall be there,’ and so on. Would you, like a
dear good fellow, mind going through the proofs,
and if you see any ‘wills’ or ‘shalls’ used wrongly,
put them right and then pass for press? Of course,
if you should spot anything else that strikes you as
wrong, I’d be infinitely obliged if you would make
the correction.”</p>

<p>I agreed, went through proofs, made the necessary
alterations, and passed for press. Two or three
days after I had a telegram from Paris. “Terrible
blunder in book, coming back specially. Stop all
proofs. Wilde.” I did so, and awaited events.
Wilde arrived in a hansom.</p>

<p>“It is not too late? For heaven’s sake tell me
it is not too late?” he affected to gasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
“Oh, make yourself easy. It was not too late.
I stopped the proofs,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” he exclaimed theatrically, throwing
himself into a chair and making a great show of
wiping away the perspiration from a perfectly dry
brow. “I should never have forgiven myself, or
you, had my book gone out disfigured by such a
blunder&mdash;by such a crime as I count it against art.”</p>

<p>Then in a faint undertone, as if the thing were too
unholy to speak of above one’s breath, he said:</p>

<p>“There’s a picture framer&mdash;a mere tradesman&mdash;in
my story, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>“What have I called him?”</p>

<p>“Ashton, I think. Yes, Ashton,” I answered.</p>

<p>He simulated a shudder and seemed to wince at
the words.</p>

<p>“Don’t repeat it! Don’t repeat it! It is more
than my shattered nerves can stand. Ashton is a
gentleman’s name,” he spoke brokenly, and wrung
his hands as if in anguish. “And I’ve given it&mdash;God
forgive me&mdash;to a tradesman! It must be
changed to Hubbard. Hubbard positively smells
of the tradesman!”</p>

<p>And having successfully worked off this wheeze
on me, Oscar became himself again, and sat up with
a happy smile to enjoy his own and my congratulations
on the exquisiteness of his art.</p>

<p>Wilde’s contempt for tradesmen, as instanced in
this anecdote, I did not share. Once, when he had
spoken thus contemptuously because a shopkeeper
was suing a certain impecunious but extravagant
artist acquaintance of his and mine for a debt incurred,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
I told Wilde that even if I despised “tradesmen”
as he and the artist did, I should despise myself
much more were I to defraud a despised tradesman
by ordering goods for which I had neither the
means nor the intention to pay. He was not in the
least offended, perhaps because the remark suggested
an aphorism&mdash;the exact wording I forget,
but it was to the effect that only mediocrity concerned
itself with tradesmen’s bills, that a writer of
genius, whether a playwright or a novelist, ran into
debt as surely as his play or his book ran into
royalties. I remember the occasion well, though I
do not remember the phrasing of his aphorism, for
on that particular morning he had, for the first time
within my experience, shown less than his usual nice
consideration for others which&mdash;whether due merely
to love of approbation or to finer feelings&mdash;made
him so agreeable and delightful a companion.</p>

<p>When he came in I offered him my cigarette case.
They were of a brand he had often himself smoked
in the past&mdash;in fact it was he who had first recommended
them to me&mdash;quite good tobacco and well
made, but moderate in price, and with no pretence
to be of the very best. He took one, lit it, drew a
few puffs, and then tossing it practically unsmoked
on the fire, drew out his own bejewelled case and lit
up one of his own. That was very unlike Wilde as
I had known him in his less prosperous days. Then
he would have said, “I have accustomed myself to
smoke another brand lately and am something of a
creature of habit. Do you mind if I smoke one of
my own?”</p>

<p>Perhaps the omission was due only to preoccupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
and forgetfulness. Perhaps the incident will
be accounted too trivial, thus seriously to put on
record. Possibly, but it is often by the cumulative
effect of small and seemingly trivial details&mdash;not
always by the bold broad strokes&mdash;that the truest
portrait is drawn. Into the tragedy of human life
we are not often permitted to look, but just as,
since all fish swim against the stream, a minnow
will serve to show the run of the current, no less than
a pike, so trivial incidents serve sometimes to point
the trend of life or of character as truly as great
happenings.</p>

<p>Nor in Wilde’s case were other signs of change in
him wanting. His first play had just then been produced
and with success. He struck me on that
particular morning as unpleasantly flushed, as
already coarsened, almost bloated by success. There
was a suspicion of insolence in his manner that was
new to me, and from that time onward he and I&mdash;perhaps
the fault was mine&mdash;seemed to lose touch
of each other, and to drift entirely apart. Wilde
died in the late autumn of 1900. I never saw or
heard from him again after the spring of 1892.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Was it not Mr. Stead who defined paradox as a
truth standing on its head? Wilde’s aim in paradox
was so to manipulate truth and falsehood as to make
the result startle one by appearing to reverse the
existing standard. A paradox by him was sometimes
a lie and a truth trotting side by side together in
double harness like a pair of horses, but each so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
cleverly disguised that one was not quite sure which
horse was which.</p>

<p>More often a paradox by Wilde was a lie (or a
seeming lie) and a truth (or a seeming truth) driven
the one in front of the other tandem-wise; but whichever
Wilde had placed last was tolerably sure to
take one by surprise by lashing out with its heels
when one came to look at it. When Wilde had carefully
arranged a paradox with a kick in it and
wished to see one jump, he spoke the first half
smilingly to put one off one’s guard. Then he would
pause, suddenly become grave and thoughtful as if
searching his words. But the pause was not for loss
of a word. It was no pause of momentary inaction.
It was, on the contrary, if I may vary the simile, like
the backward swing of a rifle, and was meant only
to give fuller play and power to the forward thrust
that bayonets an enemy. No sooner was one off
one’s guard by the smile and the momentary silence,
than swift and sure came the sting of the stab.</p>

<p>Let me give an illustration. Wilde once asked me
some question concerning my religious belief which
I did my best to answer frankly and, as he was good
enough afterwards to say, without the cant which he
so loathed. When I had made an end of it, he said
gravely:</p>

<p>“You are so evidently, so unmistakably sincere
and most of all so truthful” (all this running
smoothly and smilingly) “that” (then came the
grave look and the pause as if at a loss for a word,
followed by the swift stab) “I can’t believe a single
word you say.”</p>

<p>And so, having discharged his missile, Wilde, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
longer lolling indolently forward in his seat, pulled
himself backwards, and up like a gunner taking
a pace to the rear, or to the side of his gun the
better to see the crash of the shell upon the
target, and then, if I may so word it, “smiled all
over.” He was so openly, so provokingly pleased
with himself and with this particular paradox that
not to be a party to the gratification of such sinful
vanity, instead of complimenting him, as he had
expected, on its neatness, I ignored the palpable hit,
and inquired:</p>

<p>“Where are you dining to-night, Wilde?”</p>

<p>“At the Duchess of So-and-so’s,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Precisely. Who is the guest you have marked
down, upon whom&mdash;when everybody is listening&mdash;to
work off that carefully prepared impromptu
wheeze about ‘You are so truthful that I can’t believe
a single word you say,’ which you have just
fired off on me?”</p>

<p>Wilde sighed deeply and threw out his hands with
a gesture of despair, but the ghost of a glint of a
smile in the corner of his eye signalled a bull’s-eye
to me.</p>

<p>“Compliments are thrown away on such coarse
creatures as you,” he said. “This very morning I
called into being a new and wonderful aphorism&mdash;‘A
gentleman never goes east of Temple Bar’&mdash;notwithstanding
which I have brought wit and fame
and fashion to lighten your editorial room in the
City. Why? To pay you the supremest compliment
one artist can pay another one. To make you
the only confidant of one of my most graceful and
delicate fancies. I was about to tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
“Yes, I know,” I interpolated rudely, “you have
coined a witty new aphorism, or thought out a lovely
fancy. You do both and do them more than well.
But you are going to the Duchess’s dinner party to-night,
and you will contrive so to turn what is said
that your aphorism or fancy seems to rise as naturally
and spontaneously to the surface of the conversation
as the bubbles rise to the surface of the glass of
champagne at your side. But you are not, as actors
say, sure of your ‘words.’ You think it would be
as well to have something of the nature of a dress
rehearsal. So you have dropped in here, on your
way to your florist’s or to some one else, to try it
upon me as somebody is said to try his jokes on his
dog before publishing them. I don’t mind playing
‘dog’ in your rôle in the least, but I object to being
made a stalking-horse for the Duchess’s honoured
guest.”</p>

<p>I have no intention in these Recollections to play
the reporter to my own uninteresting share in the
conversation, but one must do so sometimes for
obvious reasons. In this case, I wish to illustrate
the means by which I sometimes succeeded in
inducing Wilde to drop attitudinising and to be
his natural self.</p>

<p>There is a certain Professor of my acquaintance,
a man of brilliant abilities and incomparable knowledge,
whom I used to meet at a club&mdash;let us call
him Clough. When Clough could be induced to talk
upon the matters in which he was an expert, he was
worth travelling many miles to hear. Unfortunately
he had an aggressive, even offensive manner, and
was troubled with self-complacent egotism. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
was only after a systematic course of roughness and
rudeness at the hands of his fellow clubmen that
Clough was endurable, or could be got to talk of
anything but himself.</p>

<p>One would sometimes hear a fellow clubman say,
“Clough is in the other room, just down from the
‘Varsity; and more full of information than ever.
Two or three capable members are administering
the usual course of medicine&mdash;‘Cloughing’ we call
it now&mdash;of flatly contradicting every word he says,
‘trailing’ him, snubbing him, and otherwise reducing
his abnormally swollen head to moderate
dimensions. Then he will be better worth listening
to on his own subjects than any other man in
England. Don’t miss it.”</p>

<p>Similarly, in my intercourse with Wilde, I found
that a certain amount of “Cloughing,” such as,
“Now then, Wilde! You know you are only showing
off, as we used to say at home when I was one
of a family of kids. Stow it, and talk sense,” had
equally good result. He would protest at first when
minded to let me off lightly, that such “engaging
ingenuousness” alarmed and silenced him. At
other times he would vow that my coarseness made
him shudder and wince&mdash;that it was like crushing
a beautiful butterfly, to bludgeon a sensitive creature
of moods and impulses with unseemly jibes and
blatant speech. Having, however, thus delivered
himself and made his protest, he would often
stultify that protest and provide me with an excuse
to myself for my Philistinism, by throwing aside his
stilts (assumed possibly because he imagined they
advertised him to advantage above the heads of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
those who walk afoot in the Vanity Fair of Literature
and Art), and by showing himself infinitely
more interesting when seen naturally and near at
hand than when stilting it affectedly in mid-air
above one’s head.</p>

<p>At times, and when he had forgotten his grievance
at being thus rudely pulled down, he would forget&mdash;egotist
that he was&mdash;even himself, in speaking of
his hopes, his ambitions and his dreams; and in his
rare flashes of sincerity would show himself as
greater and nobler of soul than many who met and
talked to him only in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> or in society perhaps
realised.</p>

<p>There is a graceful fancy of Wilde’s&mdash;I do not
know whether he ever told it in print&mdash;the hero of
which was a poet lad who had dreamed so often and
written such lovely songs about the mermaid, that
at last&mdash;since the dream-world was more real to
him than the waking world&mdash;he was convinced that
mermaids there really are in the seas around our
shores, and that if one watched long and patiently
they might by mortal eye be seen. So day and
night the poet watched and waited, but saw nothing.
And when his friends asked him, “Have you seen
the mermaids?” he answered, “Yes, by moonlight
I saw them at play among the rollers,” telling thereafter
what he had seen and with such vividness and
beauty that almost he persuaded the listeners to
believe the story. But one night by moonlight the
poet did indeed have sight of the mermaids, and in
silence he came away and thereafter told no one
what he had seen.</p>

<p>So, of Wilde himself, I cannot but hope and believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
that though he told many stories of exceeding
beauty, none of which were true, yet hidden away
in his heart was much that was gracious, true, noble
and beautiful, the story of which will now never be
known, for like the poet lad of his fantasy he told
it to no one. Of what was evil and what was good
in his life, only a merciful God can strike the balance,
and only a merciful God shall judge.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>As one who knew Wilde personally, I am sometimes
asked whether I was not instinctively aware
that the man was bad. Frankly I was not. Possibly
because scandal does not interest me, and other
things do, I had not heard the rumours which I now
understand were even then prevalent, and so I took
him as I found him, an agreeable companion, a
brilliant conversationalist, a versatile and accomplished
man of letters. On the crime of which he
has since been committed, I make no comment, if
only for the reason that I did not follow the evidence
at his trial, just as I abstained from reading Mr. W.
T. Stead’s <cite>Maiden Tribute to Modern Babylon</cite>&mdash;not
because of any innate niceness on my part, but for
the same reason which causes me to turn aside if,
in my morning’s walk, I come across offal which it is
not my business to remove. The Wilde of the days
of which I am writing was foppish in dress and
affected in manner. He talked and wrote much
nonsense, as I held it to be, about there being no
such thing as a moral or an immoral book or
picture; that the book or picture was either a work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of art, or was not a work of art, and there the matter
ended; but much of this talk I attributed to pose,
and I had even then learned that some of the men
who are most anxious to have us believe them
moralists&mdash;and stern moralists at that&mdash;are often
less moral in their life than some of those who make
no pretence of any morals at all.</p>

<p>To the folk who objected that Wilde has boasted
of being a “pagan” I replied that he probably used
the word&mdash;just then very much in vogue&mdash;in the
same sense in which Mr. Kenneth Grahame used it
when he entitled a volume, bubbling over with the
joy of life, with animal spirits, keen observation,
and exquisite humour, <cite>Pagan Papers</cite>. Wilde’s
“paganism” I took as meaning no more than that
he claimed for himself freedom from formula, most
of all freedom from cant in his attitude towards the
accepted conventions, whether literary, artistic,
social, or even religious.</p>

<p>That he was not an irreligious man, I had reason
to know. One day when we were chatting together,
Wilde mentioned a little book of mine of which I
will say no more here than that it made no uncertain
confession of the writer’s faith in Christianity.
This led Wilde&mdash;uninvited by me, for I make it a
rule never to obtrude my religious views upon
others&mdash;to express himself upon the subject of
religion, especially of Christianity, and with such
intense reverence, such manifest earnestness, that
I perhaps looked something of the surprise I felt.</p>

<p>“You are surprised,” he said, “to hear Oscar
Wilde, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poseur</i>, as people call him, the man who
is supposed to hold nothing too sacred, talking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
seriously and on serious things. <em>No</em>, I am <em>not</em>
making believe to be earnest, as I do make believe
about so much else. I am speaking as I feel, and
you will perhaps hardly realise what an intense relief
it is to meet some one to whom one can talk
about such matters without cant. It is cant and
officialdom” (he spoke bitterly) “which is keeping
the men and women who think out of the churches
to-day. It is cant which more than anything else
stands between them and Christ. Shall I tell you
what is my greatest ambition&mdash;more even than an
ambition&mdash;the dream of my life? Not to be remembered
hereafter as an artist, poet, thinker, or
playwright, but as the man who reclothed the
sublimest conception which the world has ever
known&mdash;the Salvation of Humanity, the Sacrifice
of Himself upon the Cross by Christ&mdash;with new and
burning words, with new and illuminating symbols,
with new and divine vision, free from the accretions
of cant which the centuries have gathered around
it. I should thereby be giving the world back again
the greatest gift ever given to mankind since Christ
Himself gave it, peerless and pure two thousand
years ago&mdash;the pure gift of Christianity as taught by
Christ.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on, “I hope before I die to write
the Epic of the Cross, the Iliad of Christianity,
which shall live for all time.”</p>

<p>On another occasion Wilde unfolded to me the
opening scene in a sort of religious drama which he
intended one day to write&mdash;the finding to-day of the
body of the Christ in the very rock-sepulchre where
Joseph of Arimathea had laid it, and a great and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
consequent eclipse of faith in Him and in His
resurrection. Thereafter, by a new revelation of the
Christ, Wilde was, in his drama, newly to recreate
Christianity and faith in Christianity, but of this
Second Act of his World-Drama I heard no more,
as our talk was at this point interrupted, and he
never renewed it.</p>

<p>I speak of this proposed religious drama here for
the singular reason that I, too, had long been turning
over in my mind some such work and some such
opening scene as in Wilde’s drama&mdash;I mean the
finding of the body of Christ.</p>

<p>Wilde went no further with his project, but in a
book of mine, written some years after, I carried my
own project into effect. To this day I am uncertain
how much of my opening scene was Wilde’s, and
how much mine. The idea appears to have occurred
to both, but whereas, in Wilde’s mind, it was clear
and defined, in mine it was then no more than an
idea. I sometimes wonder whether his words did
not make vivid to me what before was vague. Of
one thing at least I am sure, that he was the first to
speak of such an opening scene, which fact in itself
constitutes some sort of previous claim. The rest of
the book was entirely mine, and probably the whole,
but the facts seem to me not uninteresting, and
having made confession of the possibility at least of
some debt incurred, I must leave it to the reader to
say whether I ought or ought not to be condemned
in “conscience money.”</p>

<p>I have already said that I have reason to know
that Wilde was not irreligious, and I propose now
to give my reasons for refusing to believe him to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
irreclaimably bad. One has some hesitation in
quoting oneself, but, in a dream-parable booklet of
mine, there is a passage which I may perhaps be forgiven
for printing here, when I say that I had Wilde
in my mind when I wrote it. In my dream-parable,
Satan, even as once of old he had presented himself
to speak with God concerning Job, appears to-day
before the Most High, urging that men and women
have become godless and faithless. He craves permission
to prove this by putting them to certain
tests. The permission is accorded on condition that
Satan himself becomes mortal, even as they. In the
following passage Satan is supposed to be speaking,
after the failure and defeat of his projects.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Master and Maker, hear me ere I die. For until
Thou didst in Thy wisdom decree that ere I might
work my will on mortals, myself must become
mortal even as they&mdash;until then, the thoughts of
these mortals were as foreign to my understanding
as are the thoughts in the brain of a bird, to the
fowler who spreads his net to catch the little
creature. Like the fowler, I knew that I must
change my bait, according to the creature that I set
out to snare, that this one could be taken by avarice,
that one by vanity, a third by spiritual pride, a
fourth by bodily lust. When they came to my lure,
and I caught them; when I saw the poor fools
struggling in my net, I laughed and hugged myself
to think of their misery and of the impotent anguish
of God. And so I grew wise in the ways and the
weaknesses of men and women, while knowing
nothing of the hearts which beat in their breasts.</p>

<p>But now that I have become mortal, even as they,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>&mdash;now
at last, to the wonder and the mystery of
mortal life, are my eyes opened. Now perceive I
that, in the least and most shameful of these lives,
is to be seen, even in uttermost wreckage, something
so sacred, so august, so beautiful, so divine,
that the very angels of light might stand amazed in
envious wonder and awe.</p>

<p>For if men and women have failed greatly, at
least they have striven greatly&mdash;how greatly, how
valiantly, how desperately, only the God Who sees
all, may know.</p>

<p>It may be that by Him, that very striving itself,
even the unsuccessful striving, shall mercifully be
taken into account. The sin and the shame are
human: the wish and the effort to overcome them
are divine. For that which in a man’s truer, nobler
moments, he has longed unutterably to be, <em>that in
some sense he is, and shall be accounted</em>, in the eyes
of the God, Who taketh not pleasure in remembering
sin, but in rewarding righteousness.</p>

<p>That even in sin, a man should think such thoughts,
should carry unsullied in his heart some white
flower of his childhood, and, in spite of what is ugly
and impure in himself, should project so pure and
perfect a vision of hoped-for, longed-for Loveliness
and Purity, sets that man, even in his sins, a world
removed above the angels. When I who was once
an angel fell, I fell from uttermost light to uttermost
dark. Ceasing to be an angel, I became a devil.
Man falls, but even in his fall retains something that
is divine.</p>

<p>Yonder man into whose great brain I entered,
working strange madness within! Him first I
taught to love Beauty, because it is of Thee. Him
I haunted of beauty, haunted with visions of forms
more fair than earthly eyes may know, luring him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
at last to look upon Beauty as of greater worth
than all else, and as a law unto itself.</p>

<p>And because the love of beauty is not far removed
from the love of pleasure, it was not difficult for me
to lead on such as he to love pleasure for itself. With
innocent pleasures at first I plied him, and when
they staled, I enticed him with grosser joys, till the
pleasure-seeker became the voluptuary, and, in the
veins of the voluptuary, desire soon quickened into
lust.</p>

<p>Next, because wine, like water to drooping
flowers, lent fictitious strength to his flagging pulse,
made the live thoughts to quicken in his tired
brain, and set the tongue of his wit a-wagging;
because he loved to stand well with his comrades,
among whom to chink glasses together was the sign
of fellowship&mdash;because of all these I enticed him to
drink and yet again to drink, until Alcohol, the
Arch Destroyer, had stolen away his will power,
silenced his conscience, perverted his moral sense,
inflamed with foul passion his degenerate brain,
and made the wreck and the ruin of him that he
now is.</p>

<p>Yet even now, as I steal gloatingly through the
dark chambers of that House of Shame which was
once the fair temple of the living God, even now
there still smoulders under the ashes of a fouled
hearthstone some spark of the fire which was
kindled of God, a fire which I strive in vain to
trample out, since, because it is of God, it is inextinguishable
and eternal.</p>

<p>If therefore when I seem most to have conquered,
there never yet was God wholly defeated&mdash;of what
use is it further to wage the unequal conflict? For
God never entirely lets go His hold on a human
soul; and that to which God holds fast, Satan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
shall never finally wrest from Him. Say the world,
think the world, what it will, in the warfare for
souls God wins, and has won all along the line.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was, as I say, Wilde who was in my mind when
I penned that passage commencing “Yonder man
into whose great brain I entered, working strange
madness within.” To me he seems to have been less
hopelessly bad than partly mad.</p>

<p>We are told that it is possible, by locating and
destroying certain cells or nerve-centres in the brain,
so to affect the mind of the subject as to destroy his
sense of colour, his sense of touch, or even, it is
believed, to destroy his sense of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Wilde died of meningitis, which is a brain affection,
and I think that the fact should be considered
retrospectively. A post-mortem examination would
possibly have revealed some disease or degeneration
of certain brain-cells which may account for much
that is painful in his career and character. This
degeneration of brain-cells may have been inherited
and congenital, in which case, condemnation on our
part is silenced; or it may have been due to excesses
of his own choosing and committing. Even
if this be so, the price he paid was surely so terrible,
and so tragic, as in a sense to be accounted an atonement,
and even to entitle him to our pity. In the
passage quoted from my dream-parable, I have
hinted at some form of demoniacal possession which
may or may not be a positive, as opposed to a
negative form of madness. There is a brain derangement
by which the power to reason aright and to
co-ordinate ideas is lost; a brain derangement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
which results mainly in vacancy of mind. But there
is yet another and more terrible form of derangement
in which, so it seems to me, that unseen evil
powers, outside himself, seize upon and possess the
brain chambers, thus vacated, and direct and rule
the unhappy victim, not according to his own will,
which indeed has passed out of his control, but
according to the wish or will of the power by which
he is possessed.</p>

<p>On such a question we dare not dogmatise; but
I am humbly of opinion that in the great re-awakening
to the realities (not to the outward forms) of
religion, which some of us think will follow the war,
there will be a return to simplicity of belief, and that
the too often disregarded New Testament explanation
of certain mysterious happenings will be proved
to be more in accordance with the later discoveries
of Science than some advocates of the Higher
Criticism now think. For my own part I have never
doubted the accuracy of the Gospel records in regard
to demoniacal possession. We have Christ’s own
words: “For this saying go thy way; the devil is
gone out of thy daughter,” “Howbeit this kind
goeth not out but by prayer and fasting,” and “I
charge thee come out of him and enter no more into
him.”</p>

<p>That some men and women whose wills are
weakened&mdash;possibly by habitual disregard of conscience
or by continued wrongdoing for which they
cannot be held irresponsible&mdash;<em>do</em> commit, under the
urging and direction of evil spirits by which they
are possessed, crimes and cruelties for which they
are not in the fullest sense responsible, I think more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
than possible. My friend, the late Benjamin Waugh,
Founder of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, on more than one occasion placed before
me the full facts and the indisputable proofs of acts
so fiendish as to be difficult to ascribe to human
motive or passions.</p>

<p>In the most terrible sonnet ever penned, Shakespeare
says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The expense of spirit in a waste of shame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is lust in action, and till action, lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and, to lust, some particularly bestial outrages
which came before the Society were clearly attributable.
Others were as clearly the outcome of
avarice, greed, hatred, jealousy and blind fury of
anger. But some crimes there were, such as the
torturing of her own children by a mother, and, in
another case, the deliberate jabbing out of the eyes
of an unoffending pony by a woman, not under the
influence of drink, and in whom the medical experts
declared they otherwise found no symptoms of insanity,
which, if only for the sake of our common
humanity, one would be relieved to think were due
to demoniacal possession, for which the victim was,
in this last stage at least, irresponsible.</p>

<p>In the near future it is possible that Science will
by closer inquiry and by completer records be found
once more in harmony with Scripture. Hypnotism,
a science which as yet is not a science, but merely
a haphazard accumulation of unorganised data,
pointing to the possession of unexplained powers
and possibilities by the individual, has established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the fact that the living can thus be influenced and
obsessed by the living. If so, why not by the dead,
who, when emancipated from the body, may possibly
be able to concentrate even greater spiritual force
upon the living than when they were themselves
alive?</p>

<p>I am not likely to live to see it, but my belief is
that all these so-called occult matters, Hypnotism,
Thought-reading, Obsession, Clairvoyance, Spiritualism,
and the like will one day fall into line with
Science, and be proved to be not supernatural, but
merely the manifestation of natural laws&mdash;of certain
psychical powers and forces which may be easily
explainable and demonstrable with further and
exacter knowledge, but concerning the working of
which we are at present very much in the dark.</p>

<p>I have written at greater length than I intended,
in hinting and in hoping that Wilde was at times
under the subjection of powers and forces of darkness
outside himself. I say “at times” intentionally,
and for the following reason. It would be
gratifying to one’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i> (I use a French
term for once, as it expresses my meaning more
nearly than any English equivalent) could I take
high ground, and aver that I was vaguely conscious&mdash;warned,
as it were, by some fine instinct&mdash;of
evil in the presence of Wilde, but so to aver would
be untrue. I have not lived to nearly threescore
years without meeting men from whom one does
thus instinctively shrink, and concerning whom one
found it impossible to breathe the same air. I experienced
nothing of the sort in Wilde’s company,
and, since his guilt seems uncontrovertible, I ask myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
whether it is not possible that Wilde lived a sort
of Jekyll and Hyde life, of the latter of which I saw
nothing, inasmuch as just as some wounded or
plague-stricken creature withdraws itself from the
herd, so, during the Hyde period of madness or
of obsession, some instinct moved him to withdraw
from his home, his haunts and the companions of
his everyday life, only to return when the obsession
or madness had passed, and once again he was his
sane and normal self.</p>

<p>This “periodicity” is not infrequent in madness,
whether the madness be due to a brain derangement,
explainable by pathology, or to some such demoniacal
possession as that of which I have spoken. A memorable
instance is that of Mary Lamb, who was herself
aware of the return of homicidal mania, and at such
times of her own accord placed herself under restraint.
Recalling the fact that I saw in Wilde no
sign either of the presence of evil or of insanity, I
ask myself whether in picturing Dorian Grey as at
one season living normally and reputably, and at
another disappearing into some oblivion of iniquity,
he was not consciously or unconsciously picturing
for us his own tortured self. I write “tortured”
advisedly, for whether he were wholly, or only
partly, or not at all, responsible, I refuse to believe
that the man, as in his saner moments I knew him,
<em>could</em> sink thus low, without fighting desperately, if
vainly&mdash;how desperately only the God who made
him knows&mdash;before allowing himself in the hopelessness
of despair to forget his failures in filth, as
other unhappy geniuses have before now drowned
their souls in drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
One talk with him I particularly remember. I
had been reading the proofs of <cite>Dorian Grey</cite>, and, on
our next meeting, I said that he had put damnable
words into the mouth of one of his characters.</p>

<p>“Such poisonous stuff is not likely to affect grown
men and women,” I said, “but for a writer of
your power and persuasiveness to set up a puppet
like Lord Henry to provide ready-made excuses
for indulgence, and to make evil seem necessary,
unavoidable, and easy, by whispering into the ears
of readers, of impressionable age and inflammable
passion, that ‘the only way to get rid of a temptation
is to yield to it’&mdash;when you do that, you are
helping to circulate devils’ doctrines in God’s
world.”</p>

<p>Wilde was visibly perturbed.</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” he said. “It <em>is</em> damnable;
it <em>is</em> devils’ doctrine. I will take it out.”</p>

<p>But, alas, other influences, whether within himself
in the shape of the whisperings of some evil
spirit, by which he was, as I believe, at times possessed,
or in the form of so-called friends, whose
influence over him was of the worst, I cannot say,
but some days after the conversation recorded above
I received the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Grand Hôtel de L’athenée,<br />
<span class="l2">15 Rue Scribe, Paris.</span></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">Thank you for your charming letter. I have
been very ill and unable to correct my proofs, but
have sent them off now. <em>I have changed my mind
about the passage about temptation.</em> One can’t pull<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
a work of art about without spoiling it, and after all
it is merely Luther’s “Pecca Fortiter” put dramatically
into the lips of a character.</p>

<p>Do you think I should add to preface the definition
of “morbid” and “unhealthy” art I gave
in the <cite>Fortnightly</cite> for February? The one on
morbidity is really good.</p>

<p>Will you also look after my “wills” and “shalls”
in proof! I am Celtic in my use of these words, not
English.</p>

<p>You are excellent on Rossetti. I read you with
delight.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Your sincere friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>When next I met Wilde I recurred to the matter,
but it was then too late, for the book, he said, was in
great part printed. Moreover, he had now another
excuse to put forward.</p>

<p>“After I had left you,” he said, “I remembered
that a friend of mine, a well-known critic, had
read the book in manuscript when it was first
written. He said something to the same effect
as you did, but less strongly. Honestly it was
that, more than anything else, which finally decided
me to leave the passage in. Had I taken it out, he
would have claimed that I did so in deference to his
strictures, and haul down my flag to a professional
critic I never have and never will.”</p>

<p>This incident (though Wilde has been dead sixteen
years I have neither written of it nor spoken
of it before) shows Wilde as weak, it shows him as
yielding&mdash;as we all, alas, too often yield&mdash;to evil
influences, and to inclination as opposed to conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
and as a man who was determined to shine
at all costs. His vanity would not allow him to
withhold the word that he was pleased to think
daring, original, and above all brilliant, though he
knew that word to be only brilliantly bad. Even
in his sinning, it seems to me, he fed and flattered
his insatiable vanity, by electing, even in sin, to be
unlike others; and how far vanity, even more than
viciousness, was accountable for Wilde’s downfall,
only the God who made him and the devil who
fostered and fed that vanity, till it less resembled a
pardonable human weakness than a hideous excrescence
and disease, can ever truly say.</p>

<p>The setting of Wilde’s sun (which had risen on so
fair a prospect, and with such promise of splendour)
in foul quagmires of sin and shame, was the greatest
tragedy I have known. I met his friend and mine,
Mr. Hall Caine, immediately after the verdict and
sentence. I have seen Caine ill, and I have seen him
deeply moved, even distressed, but I remember
always to his honour (for Wilde not seldom made
Caine’s writing the butt of his wit) the anguish in
his face as he said:</p>

<p>“God pity him in this hour when human pity
there seems none! To think of it! that man,
that genius as he is, whom you and I have seen
fêted and flattered! whose hand we have grasped
in friendship! a felon, and come to infamy unspeakable!
It haunts me, it is like some foul and horrible
stain on our craft and on us all, which nothing can
wash out. It is the most awful tragedy in the whole
history of literature.”</p>

<h2 id="h_236">S. J. STONE, THE HYMN-WRITER</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Rev. S. J. Stone, <span class="smcap smaller">M.A.</span>, was the author
of two hymns that are known wherever
the English tongue is spoken, one the
beautiful Lenten litany of love, trust and repentance,
“Weary of earth and laden with my sin”;
the other that soul-stirring triumph-song, “The
Church’s One Foundation,” which&mdash;set as it is to
majestic battle-march music that fires the imagination&mdash;has
become, as it were, the Marseillaise of the
Church militant and victorious.</p>

<p>When Stone died, and where he wished to die, in
the Charterhouse, the busy world learned that the
Rector of a City Church, who had done memorable
work in an East End parish, and was the author of
some famous hymns, had passed away. Those who
knew and loved him were aware that a great soul,
a hero-heart, a rarely beautiful spirit, had gone to
God.</p>

<p>In my little life, the years of which are fast approaching
threescore, it has so happened that I have
known, sometimes intimately, a number of so-called
“eminent” women and men. I have known not a
few who in intellectual power, in the brilliance of
their gifts, their attainments and achievements, or
in what is called “fame,” stood immeasurably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
higher than Stone. I have known none who, judged
by the beauty, purity, and nobility of life and
character, was half as great as he. I do not say this,
be it noted, under the emotional stress which follows
the death of a dearly-loved friend. In such an hour
of bitter self-reproach when in retrospect we think
of the kindly act which, had it been done (alas, that
it was not done!) would have helped our friend
through a time of trouble; the generous word
which had it been spoken (alas, that it remained
unspoken!) might have heartened him when we
knew him to be most cast down&mdash;these and possibly
our poignant sense of remorse, it may be for an
actual wrong done, not infrequently cause us to
lose our sense of proportion. For the time being at
least we over-estimate what was good in him, and
under-estimate what was indifferent, or worse.</p>

<p>It is not so that I write of S.&nbsp;J. Stone. Sixteen
long years, in which life has never been, nor will be,
quite the same, missing that loved presence, have
passed away since he was laid to rest in Norwood
Cemetery; and to-day with my own life’s end nearing
I can say, not only for myself, but for many
others who knew him, that so brave of heart was he
as to make possible for us the courage of a Cœur de
Lion, so knightly of nature as to make possible the
honour of an Arthur or a Galahad, so nearly stainless
in the standard he set himself, in the standard
he attained, as to come, as near as human flesh and
blood can come, almost to making possible the
purity of the Christ.</p>

<p>I am not unaware what will be in the mind of
many who read these words. Some will suspect me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
if not of insincerity, at least of the foolish use of
superlative and hyperbole. Not a few will hold my
last comparison as scarcely reverent. And all the
while there will not be a single woman or man, with
any intimate knowledge of Stone, who, reading what
I have written, will not say, at least of what is
wholly appreciative (many will resent what I have
hereafter to say of his temperamental weaknesses
and human defects), “All this is truth, sober and
unexaggerated, and yet the man himself was in
many respects infinitely greater than he is drawn.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Ever since Stone died my intention has been, before
laying down my own pen, some day and so far
as I am able, to picture him as I knew him. It
seemed to me a duty, no less than a trust, that some
of us should put on record what manner of man it
was who wrote these noble hymns, and how nobly
he lived and died. My reason for delaying thus long
about what to me is a labour of love, was the difficulty
of picturing Stone as he was, without seeming
to exaggerate. Fortunately it has not been left
only to me to bear tribute, for the Rev. F.&nbsp;G. Ellerton,
Vicar of Ellesmere, to whose father we owe the
famous hymn, “Saviour, again to Thy dear Name
we raise,” has written a Memoir of his former Vicar
(I recollect Mr. Ellerton as Stone’s curate, more
than a score of years ago), which was prefixed to a
volume of “Selections” from Stone’s <cite>Poems and
Hymns</cite>. Only one who had lived and worked with
Stone could have drawn so true and sympathetic a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
picture of Stone the Christian, Stone the Churchman,
Stone the hymn-writer, and Stone the man;
and, except for the fact that Mr. Ellerton and I
approach our subjects from different standpoints,
his beautiful Appreciation will be found amply to
confirm what I say in my briefer Silhouette.</p>

<p>It is to a sister of mine that I owe my first meeting
with Stone. From her girlhood upward she had
contributed poems, sketches and stories to the
magazines, earning each year by her pen sums which
to the rest of us&mdash;how wonderful it all was!&mdash;seemed
princely, and very proud of her we all
were.</p>

<p>Ill-health, and her determination never, after
marriage, to let her writing interfere with her duties
as wife and mother, have prevented her from following
up, except very occasionally, the work in literature
which she so loved, though two years ago she
was able to publish, and with success, a first long
novel.</p>

<p>But at that time she had made some girlish reputation
as a writer of religious verse, and was commissioned
to contribute “A Golden Song” each
week to a well-known periodical. Stone’s attention
was attracted by the sweet-briar simplicity and
beauty of some of these “Golden Songs,” and when
he and my sister chanced to meet, each was singularly
drawn to the other, and so it was that first she
and he, thereafter he and I, became friends and remained
so to the end.</p>

<p>Now let me try to describe Stone as he was at the
time of our first meeting, when he was in early
middle life. Emerson said once that we take a man’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
measure when first we meet him&mdash;and every time
we meet him. One’s first comment at sight of Stone
would inevitably have been: “A Man!” And one’s
second: “An Englishman!”</p>

<p>Englishman was written, as the phrase runs, “all
over him”&mdash;in appearance, in voice, as well as bearing&mdash;and
I can conceive no disguise out of which the
unmistakable Englishman would not have peeped.
Unmistakably English as he was in appearance,
yet, when one talked with him, and he became interested,
enthusiastic, excited, when he spoke of
his life’s work, his life’s hopes and dreams, but
most of all when one could induce him to talk of
England, Oxford, patriotism, loyalty, love, duty or
poetry, and saw the flash in the eye, the throb at
the temples, and heard the thrill in the voice, one’s
next comment was, “Here surely is not part Anglo-Saxon,
but all Celt!”</p>

<p>The Celt in him, for&mdash;though he never told us
whence it came&mdash;the quicksilver of Celtic blood,
there must have been in his veins, made mock continually
of the Anglo-Saxon. Yet, either the Fairy
Godmother, or the forgotten forbear who was responsible
for this freakish intermingling of quick-running
Celtic blood, all ardour and eagerness, with
the slower, surer and steadier pulsing of an Anglo-Saxon
strain, doled out to Stone none of the Celtic
defects but only of the Celtic best. From the
irritability, uncertainty, and the “impossibility”
which make some Celts&mdash;at all events some of us
Irishmen&mdash;an inscrutable problem and mystery of
Providence, as well as an ever-present perplexity to
our best friends, Stone was entirely free. In that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
respect he was inwardly, and in character, as truly
English as he was truly English in the outer man.</p>

<p>He was of exceptional physique and presence.
Only slightly above the middle height, but muscular
of limb, broad and square-shouldered, and deep-chested
as a lion, Stone was a fine specimen of virile
manhood. Proud of his strength, for, though devoid
of vanity, he had his full share of what I may call a
seemly and proper pride, he carried himself well and
erectly&mdash;head up, shoulders squared&mdash;walking with
a step that was firm, steady and soldierly.</p>

<p>And here I may interpolate that, a soldier’s grandson
as he was, all Stone’s boyhood longings were set
on soldiering. Only the knowledge that it was the
heart’s desire of the father and mother he so revered
that he should follow his father by taking Holy
Orders, and later the conviction that he was called
of God to the ministry, kept him from a commission
in the Army. His renunciation of his boyhood’s
dream was the first great act of obedience in a life
of consistent obedience and devotion to duty. The
sacrifice&mdash;as it was&mdash;of his own wishes, was made
manfully and uncomplainingly, and he threw himself
whole-heartedly thereafter into his ministerial work.
But the pang remained, and to the last, when he
spoke of soldiering, there was that in his voice and
in his eye which reminded one of an exile, looking
across far waters to the land of his birth. To Stone,
to have led a company, or a half-company, and for
the first time, into action in the service of his
Sovereign and of his country, would have been, in
the words of George Meredith, the very “bend of
passion’s rapids,” as supreme a moment as Rossetti’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“sacred hour for which the years did sigh.”
That he would have made a gallant soldier, I am sure,
but not a great one. Leading a charge, he would
have been irresistible, but his was too highly-strung,
too impulsive a temperament, calmly to
plan out and to carry through the cold-blooded
details of a campaign. He was to the last a soldier
in heart, if not in looks, for, by the beard and a
certain breezy bluffness of presence, he might very
well have passed for a sailor. The head was finely
moulded and on large leonine lines, the forehead
broad, full and lofty, the nose strong, straight,
purposeful and well-proportioned, and the set of
the firm mouth, and the shaping of the determined
chin, were in keeping with the forcefulness and the
frankness of the eyes and of the whole face. The
darkness&mdash;so dark as to be almost black&mdash;of the
straight thick hair, which was brushed up and off the
forehead, accentuated the Saxon ruddiness of his
complexion and the glossy red-brown (like that of a
newly-fallen chestnut) of his crisply curling moustache
and beard, which in sunlight were almost
auburn.</p>

<p>His eyes instantly challenged and held your own,
for he invariably looked the person to whom he
spoke fully and fearlessly, but never inquisitively
(one cannot think of the word in connection with
Stone), in the face; and it was his eyes that most
remained in your memory when he was gone. “Intent,”
set, and full of fire, the look in them was like
the spoken word of command which calls soldiers
to attention. Brown in colouring, they were not the
hard, glittering and unrevealing brown which one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
sometimes sees in woman or in man, but eyes that,
when he was reading poetry, could shine as if his
soul were a lit taper, of which they were the flame.
At other times, I have seen them as merry as a
happy boy’s, as untroubled as cool clear agate
stones at the bottom of a brook. His were eyes that
recalled the love and devotion which look out at us
from the eyes of some nobly-natured dog, yet eyes
that when he was preaching, and the very soul within
him was trembling under a terrible sense of responsibility
to his people and to God, could burn
fiercely red, like a fanned coal in a furnace, but
always as true, brave and loyal eyes as ever looked
out of human head.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the fact that Stone was at heart intensely
human lay the secret of his hold upon the hearts
of others. I have claimed high place for him and
have called him by high name, but a “saint” at
least I have never called him nor claimed him to be.
We have been told that it is impossible to be heroic
in a high hat, nor is it easy to picture a “saint” in
a very pepper of a temper (to say nothing of a boating
sweater) at loggerheads, and more than half
minded to knock down, a foul-mouthed bargee.
Stone’s Homeric laughter would not have accorded
ill with some Valhalla of the gods, but his rollicking
sense of fun, his schoolboy high spirits, still remembered
affectionately and joyfully as they are
by some who were with him, first as a boy, and thereafter
as more than a middle-aged man at Charterhouse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
suggest neither a nimbus nor the Saints’
Calendar.</p>

<p>In later life, when the endless calls upon his time
barred him from following, other than rarely, the
field sports that he so loved, and even from the
exercise which was so necessary for a man of his
physique, Stone not only put on weight, as happens
always with athletes out of training, but developed
a tendency to stoutness&mdash;not, I gather, from some
study of the Old Masters, in keeping with the
character of Saints, who as a class do not appear to
run to flesh.</p>

<p>Neither in looks nor in his life was there anything
about Stone of the ascetic who, living aloof and
apart, tells over to himself&mdash;the beads, as it were, in
a rosary of self-mortification&mdash;the list of pleasures
denied, until in the contemplation of his self-denials
he comes at last to find a melancholy pleasure.
Stone, on the contrary, was the most natural and
normal of men, with a healthy appetite for the good
things of this world. If he fasted, as was the case
during such a season as Holy Week, none knew of
it except himself. He held that the season, in which
the Church bids us look back in awe and worship
upon the agony of our Lord’s Passion, is not a
time for bodily indulgence by Christ’s minister.
But fasting in a monkish sense, or as followed by
the Roman Catholic Church, he neither followed
himself nor enjoined others to follow, and such
fasting as he practised was more in the way of
salutary discipline than anything else, and he
imposed no fasting upon others.</p>

<p>None the less, though Stone was, as I have said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
no saint, I doubt whether any saint who was ever
canonised had half so child-pure a heart or lived
half so stainless a life. His was not the negative
purity of the cold-blooded, the anæmic, or the
passionless, to whom the temptations of the flesh
made small appeal. He was a full-blooded, healthy
and whole-natured man, a splendid “animal,” by
whom the animal (which by God’s wisdom and grace
is in us all) was not done violence to, stamped down,
crushed out, and unnaturally suppressed, to his own
physical and spiritual detriment and even danger.
That is the unwisest of all courses to pursue. By
mutilating and maiming the beautiful work and
image of God in us, which since He made it must in
itself be innocent and beautiful, we sin against our
own human nature and against God. Human
nature is like a tree. It must have space in which
to fulfil the purpose for which it was intended, and
in which to grow. Crush down, and seek to crush
out, its natural expansion, and it takes distorted
shapes (crippled limbs, as it were, on the tree of life)
and hideous fungus-like boles and excrescences
appear on what would otherwise have been a fair,
straight, and shapely young growth. In Stone (to
return to my original metaphor) the animal, which is
in us all, was not a beast to be bludgeoned down, or
to drag us to earth, but a beautiful wild and winged
creature which brings strength and gladness to
human life, and, wisely guided and controlled, may
even bear us aloft and afar. In Stone it was so
dominated by an iron will, so sublimated by knightly
and noble ideals, and by his innate purity of soul, as
to make impossible what was gross, sensual or base.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
And may I add, perhaps wickedly, that the animal
in him was sometimes a joy as when by sheer brute
force, if you like so to call it, he fell upon (so I was
once told) three blackguards who, late one dark
night, were foully assaulting a poor girl in what was
then a lonely part of London Fields. Stone heard
her screams, rushed to her help, and knocked out his
first man with one blow. Then he closed with
number two, and trouncing him so soundly that the
fellow howled for mercy, flung him to the ground,
and made off after number three, who had taken to
his heels.</p>

<p>I can well imagine Stone’s sportsmanlike joy and
the flash of his eyes when, as I am informed, he said,
“Thank heaven I learned to use my fists at Charterhouse!
and thank heaven for what rowing did for
my biceps at Oxford. I think I’ve given those two
scoundrels a lesson.” He shook his head reminiscently
and mournfully. “I’d have given five
pounds to have got my fists on that third rascal’s
hide. Honestly, I’ve enjoyed pommelling those
other two scoundrels more than anything that has
happened since I came to Haggerston.”</p>

<p>Then, seeing, perhaps, a whimsical look in his
companion’s eye, and perhaps already asking himself
whether “taking on” three blackguards at
fisticuffs, and badly punishing two out of the three
in a fair fight, would by every one be considered
decorous or becoming in a clergyman, he broke into
infectious laughter that was directed entirely
against himself.</p>

<p>No, apart from the question whether this story
(I tell it as it was told me long ago) be true or not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
true, I do not claim for S.&nbsp;J. Stone that he was a
saint. To some men the consciousness of what
Stevenson called “a healthy dash of the brute”
necessitates an ever watchful “on guard” lest one
day the brute spring out to overpower the angel. To
Stone&mdash;so wholly had he made honour, purity, and
truth the very habit of his life&mdash;a lapse into anything
false, impure, or dishonourable, into thinking
or speaking, or even into allowing others, in his
presence, to speak what was evil or slanderous, had
become impossible. Had the proofs, or what seemed
like the proofs, of some base act on Stone’s part been
brought to the knowledge of any friend who knew
him, as I knew him, that friend would not have
stooped to examine them. His reply would have
been, “I know this man, and though I am aware
that he can be prejudiced, stubborn, overbearing,
irritable, and that faults of temper, errors of judgment,
and the like, may be laid to his charge, I know
him well enough to be sure that of what is base
he is incapable. Were all the facts before me,
they would do no more than reveal him, possibly in
a quixotic, but at least in a nobly chivalrous
light.”</p>

<p>For all his quixotism, chivalry, and hot-headedness,
Stone held so strongly that, as Christ’s minister,
a clergyman must in certain matters be so entirely
beyond even a shadow of reproach, that he was
singularly wise and guarded in his dealings with the
other sex. The foolish girls or women who go simpering
to a clergyman, especially if a bachelor as
Stone was, to ask advice on love-affairs and the like,
he instantly if considerately dismissed to seek the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
advice of their mother or of some good woman known
to him; and at all times, and upon all questions, he
avoided seeing women-callers alone&mdash;not because he
feared evil in them or in himself, but because he felt
he owed it to his sacred office to avoid even the
appearance of anything upon which evil-thinking
folk might choose to put an evil construction.</p>

<p>He was not without experiences&mdash;what clergyman
is?&mdash;of, in other respects, worthy and well-meaning
women who, even in connection with Church work,
contrive to set people by the ears, or otherwise to
cause dissension and trouble. With these he was
impatient. He did not hesitate to deal summarily
with them, nor firmly, if considerately, to speak his
mind; but Womanhood, I might almost say every
woman, he held, if only for his own mother’s sake,
if only because of a woman the Saviour of the world
was born, in a reverence that no folly or sin could
altogether break down. I have heard him speak to
the poor harlot of the street&mdash;his “Sister” as he
would not have hesitated to call her&mdash;with sorrowful
courtliness, and with the pitifulness, the gentleness,
and the consideration, which one uses to (as
indeed not a few of such unhappy women are) an
erring and ignorant child.</p>

<p>I remember, on another and very different occasion,
a girl of the soft and silly type coming to the
vicarage one day when I was with Stone&mdash;I think
she came about a Confirmation Class. She had a
certain innocence in her face; not the challenging,
starry purity that one sees in some faces, but a negative,
babyish innocence, which was pretty enough,
and appealing in its way, but that meant no more,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
probably, than that the girl had not yet had to make
choice for herself between good and evil.</p>

<p>“Did you notice the flower-like beauty of that
child’s face?” Stone asked me, when she had gone.
“In the presence of such exquisite purity and innocence,”
he went on gravely, and with intense
reverence in his voice, “one feels convicted of sin,
as it were. One is so conscious of one’s own coarseness,
grossness, and impurity as to feel unworthy to
stand in such presence!”</p>

<p>And all the time, the white armour of purity in
which he was clad, the armour and purity of his own
soul’s&mdash;a strong man’s&mdash;forging, was compared with
hers, as is the purity of fine gold tried in the furnace
to metal mixed with base earth and newly brought
all untested from a mine.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>His unfailing sense of humour, his boyish and
buoyant love of fun, like the cork jacket by means
of which a swimmer rides an incoming wave, carried
Stone through difficulties which would have depressed
another. Let me put one such instance on
record. To brighten in any way the drab days of the
poorest folks in his East End parish, he counted a
privilege as well as a happiness, and he was constantly
devising means for bringing some new gladness
to their lives&mdash;the gift of a sorely needed bit of
furniture, or a coveted ornament, a boating party
with the children in Victoria Park, a magic-lantern
entertainment&mdash;anything in fact which seemed to
him likely to make them forget their many troubles
and to call them out of themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Most of the women in his parish were poor, many
pitifully so. Here was a wife toiling all day in a
laundry, to keep the home together, while her husband
was out of work, or worse still, while her
husband was on the drink; and there, a widow, the
sole support of several children.</p>

<p>One day when Stone received an unexpected
cheque&mdash;I think it was for the sale of his book of
poems&mdash;he unfolded to me, radiant himself with
happiness at the thought, a plan for taking some
score of the very poorest mothers of the parish for
an outing to Southend.</p>

<p>The great day&mdash;as it was in the lives of these poor
people&mdash;came, and was fortunately fine. The party
caught an early train to Southend, spent a long
summer day by the sea, gathered at the appointed
time, happy if tired, at the railway station, to find
that Stone had misread the time-table, and that the
last train to London had just gone. Here were some
twenty mothers&mdash;mostly with husbands who looked
to them for the preparation and cooking of supper
at night, and of breakfast next morning. To these
husbands telegrams of explanation and appeasement
must, if the worse came to the worst, and return
that night were impossible, be despatched.
Other mothers there were with children awaiting
their mother’s home-coming for a last meal and to
be put to bed; and all the twenty good women&mdash;if
to London they could not get that night&mdash;themselves
requiring supper, and some decent place in
which to sleep. Stone’s face, brick-red with mortified
self-anger at his own muddling, as the agitated
mothers crowded and clamoured around him, two or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
three shrilly or tearfully expatiating on the terrible
things that would await them at the hands of their
lord and master, should that lord and master and
the children go supperless to bed, and rise breakfastless
next morning, was, I am told, a study in
dismay and bewilderment, until he discovered that,
by paying for it out of his own pocket, a special train
could be run.</p>

<p>Relieved to find that no one except himself would
have to suffer for his carelessness, and even while
ruefully regarding the document by the signing of
which he made himself responsible for the entire
cost (no inconsiderable sum to a poor man as he was)
of the special train, the Gilbertian side of the situation&mdash;that
he, a bachelor, should have a score of
wives and mothers upon his hands&mdash;dawned upon
him. He broke, so my informant tells me, into bluff
and hearty Berserker-like laughter, till his chestnut
beard wagged, and his burly form rocked; and
vowing that&mdash;though he must in consequence go
short for many a day of every luxury&mdash;the lesson he
had received, and the story which he would then be
able to tell against himself, were cheap at the price,
he signed the document, and made mock of himself
and his own carelessness all the way home.</p>

<p>Another story was once told me of Stone, concerning
the accuracy of which I have my doubts.
What happened might well, I admit, have happened
to him, but my impression is that it was a friend of
his who was the guilty party. However, here is the
story, as it was told me, of Stone.</p>

<p>He was to take an afternoon service at a church&mdash;I
think in Hoxton. Like many poets and some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
clergymen he was not always punctual, and when
he arrived he surmised, by the fact that the bell
had stopped, and that there was no thin and
dribbling stream of late-comers filing through the
doors, that he was more than a little late. The
congregation as he saw was on its knees, so diving
into the vestry, which was empty, he hastily threw
his surplice over his head, and hurrying to his place
in the chancel, read out the opening words of the
Evening Prayer.</p>

<p>“When the wicked man turneth away from his
wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that
which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive,”
and thence passed on to the familiar “Dearly beloved
brethren,” and so on to the end of the service&mdash;to
discover when returning to the vestry, that he
had inflicted upon the unfortunate congregation
the penance of two Evensongs on the same afternoon.
He had been under the impression that the
service commenced at four o’clock, whereas the hour
fixed was three. In Stone’s absence the curate-in-charge
had felt that there was nothing for it but for
him, the curate, to read the service himself, which
he did, and in fact he had made an end of it, had
pronounced the Benediction, and for some reason
had left the church, not by the vestry, but by
another door leading direct to the vicarage. It was
the custom at the church in question for the congregation
to stand while the clergy were passing out,
and to return to their knees for a brief silent prayer,
after the clergy had passed out. It was at this
moment that Stone is supposed to have arrived and
hurried in, to begin the service all over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>At Oxford Stone had been an athlete, and an
athlete and sportsman&mdash;oarsman, skater, fisherman
and first-class shot&mdash;he remained almost to his
life’s end. He was captain of the Pembroke boat,
and stroked the college eight. Legend has it that
he was chosen for his “Blue”&mdash;but did not have
the honour of rowing against Cambridge for the
following reason.</p>

<p>Between his merits as an oarsman and those of
another candidate, there was absolutely nothing to
choose. The other man was as good as, but no
better than Stone, and Stone was as good as, but
no better than, the other. As a way out of the
difficulty it was thought best to decide the question
by the spin of a coin, and Stone’s luck was uppermost.
He was delighted, for no man would more
eagerly have coveted his “Blue” than he, until he
learned that it was a matter of “now or never” for
his rival, who was shortly going down, and so would
stand no other chance of rowing in the great race.
As it could matter neither way for the boat’s success
which had the seat, Stone, who was staying on at
Pembroke and so would be eligible another year,
pleaded that his rival be given this, his only chance&mdash;with
the result that Stone’s own second chance never
came.</p>

<p>So runs the legend of how Stone missed his “Blue.”
As I never questioned him concerning its truth, and
he was the last man to speak of such an incident
himself, I relate it merely as it was related to me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
and with no other comment than that such impulsive
generosity is just what might have been expected
from this clerical Don Quixote of lost causes,
lost chances, forlorn hopes and self-forgetful
chivalry.</p>

<p>To say of a man that all his geese were swans, as
was often said of Stone, implies, indirectly, that he
was something of a fool, if a generous one. It is
true that Stone wished to think well of whatever
a friend had done. If it were ill done he was
not so blind as not to know it was ill done, and was
too honest not to say so, if asked for an opinion, or
to remain silent, if unasked. But if it were not ill
done, then young and keen-visioned Joy, as well as
dim-eyed Dame Pride alike clapped magnifying
glasses on nose, to show him the thing not as it was,
but as it appeared through the eyes of joy and pride
in a friend’s work.</p>

<p>So, too, in regard to the friend himself. If Stone
saw, or thought he saw, in his friend, some streak,
no matter how rudimentary or infinitesimal of, let
us say unselfishness, he saw it not as it was in his
friend, but magnified to the scale in which it existed
in himself. Hence his appreciation of a friend’s
gifts or qualities and his own gratitude for some
small service rendered were preposterously out of
all proportion to the facts. For instance, I had been
at some quite small trouble in reading, by his wish,
the proofs of his <cite>Lays of Iona</cite>, and also, by his wish,
in sending him my criticisms. Here is his letter
(Oct. 23, 1897) in acknowledgment:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">What <em>thoroughness</em> of friendship you have
shown me from first to last in the matter of the
<cite>Lays</cite>! Certainly I will alter the “no” to “not”
in the Preface, if a second edition permits me. I
had not noticed the error and jumped with a “How
could I”! of exclamation when I read your note.
You comforted me very much in the latter part of
your note when you spoke of sundry passages you
approved, especially by what you said of the
humorous part of the work. I had specially feared
about this, and indeed I had put in these two
occasional pieces only to please my sister.</p>

<p>
Good-bye, dear friend,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Ever yours gratefully and affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">S. J. Stone</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone who knew Stone intimately will bear
me out in saying that the gratitude here expressed,
and disproportionate as it may be, was absolutely
sincere. He literally glowed with gratitude for any
small service done, or trivial personal kindness, and
said no word more than he meant in making his
acknowledgment, for of “gush,” of what was
effusive or insincere, he had something like horror,
and was as incapable of it, as he was of falsehood or
of craft. And in regard to men and women whom
he loved, it was not so much that he mistook geese
for swans, as that he remembered that, on land, a
swan’s waddle is no less unlovely than a goose’s,
whereas, on water or on wing, a goose, no less than
a swan, is not without grace. He idealised his
friends&mdash;he saw in his mind’s eyes, his geese a-wing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
in the heavens or a-sail on water, as well as waddling
on land, and loved them for the possibilities, and
for the hidden graces he saw within. He was by no
means the merely credulous, if generous fool, that
some thought him. On the contrary, for most
human weaknesses, he had an uncommonly shrewd
and sharp eye, but he appealed always to the best
and noblest, never to the vain or selfish side of those
with whom he came into contact, and so his own
unwavering faith in God, in Christ, and in human
nature, was not only the cause of, but seemed to
create similar and sincere faith on the part of others,
just as his own integrity made even the rascal or the
infirm of purpose ashamed of rascality or of weakness.
But tricked, betrayed and deceived, or confronted
with evil, Stone’s wrath was terrible and consuming.</p>

<p>I remember the blaze in his eyes, the fury in his
face, concerning a scoundrel who had boasted of the
deliberate betrayal, and cowardly and calculated
desertion of a trustful girl. Had the villain fallen
at the moment, when Stone first heard the facts,
into my friend’s hands, there would have been left
upon the fellow’s body and face, and from Stone’s
fist, marks which would have borne witness to the
end of his life of the punishment he had received.
His own bitterest enemy, Stone could freely forgive,
but for the man or woman whom he held to be the
enemy of God, he had small mercy. Even in matters
not of great consequence, but upon which he felt
strongly, he was inclined to override his opponent,
and generally to carry things with a high hand.
That he always spoke, wrote, or acted with judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
I do not maintain. His motives none could
question, but his judgment, even his best friend
sometimes doubted.</p>

<p>When I speak of him as obstinate, I must not be
understood as meaning the type of obstinacy which
is more frequently associated with weakness than
with strength. Obstinacy, however, of a sort&mdash;stubbornness
if you so like to call it&mdash;was undoubtedly
a temperamental defect. He was inflexibly convinced
that his own beliefs in regard to God, to the
Throne, to the State, to the Church, and even in
regard to politics&mdash;inherited as some of these beliefs
were, influenced as were others by class feeling, by
education, and by environment&mdash;were the only
possible beliefs for a Christian, a Churchman, an
Englishman and a gentleman. Hence he could not
understand the position of those who differed, and
was impatient of opposition.</p>

<p>I once heard him described by some one who
misunderstood him as a man with a grievance, and
a man with too thin a skin. His sensitiveness I do
not deny, but it was a sensitiveness which was all
for others, never for himself. And so far from being
one of those single-cuticle abnormalities whose skin
“goose-fleshes” at the very thought of cold, who
at the approach of a rough blast wince in anticipation
as well as in reality, and suffer more perhaps
from the imagined effects of the buffeting than from
the buffeting itself, Stone not only never troubled
to ask whether the blast was, or was not, coming
his way, but enjoyed battling with it when it came.
If things went badly with him, he took Fate’s blows
unconcernedly, and blamed only himself. About<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
his own ills and sorrows, or breakdown in health,
he was the most cheerful of men, but he could and
would concern himself about the sorrows or troubles
of others, and would move heaven and earth in his
efforts to right their wrongs, if wrongs to be righted
there were. That is not the way of the man with a
grievance. The man with a grievance growls but
never fights. He wears his grievance as a badge
in his buttonhole, that all may see, and you could
do him no unkinder turn than to remove the cause
of it.</p>

<p>Stone never had a grievance, but he was ready to
make the grievances of his people, real grievances,
their grievous wrongs, not fancied ones, his own; and
more than one employer of sweated labour, more
than one owner of an insanitary slum, and occasionally
some Parish Council, or public body in
which Bumbledom and vested interests were not
unknown, had cause to think Stone too touchy, too
sensitive, and too thin-skinned, where the lives of
little children, and the bodily and spiritual welfare
of his people were concerned.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In politics Stone was the stoutest of old-fashioned
Tories, and by every instinct and sympathy an
aristocrat. Like a certain courtier of high birth
who expressed pleasure at receiving the Garter
because “there is no pretence of damned merit
about it,” he believed whole-heartedly in the hereditary
principle. I am not sure, indeed, that he would
not have thought it well that spiritual as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
temporal rank should go by inheritance. An archbishop
who came of a long line of archbishops and
was trained from birth upwards for that high office,
Stone would probably have held to be a more fitting
Spiritual Head than one whose preferment was due
to his politics, to his suavity, and to the certainty
that he would act upon “safe” and conventional
lines. He believed in Government at home and
abroad, in Great Britain as well as in her Dominions
and Colonies, by the “ruling orders,” by the class
that he held to be born with the power to command.
In himself he possessed the power to command in
a remarkable degree. I have heard him sternly
rebuke and even silence seditious or blasphemous
Sunday afternoon speakers in Victoria or Hyde
Park, and I do not remember one occasion when he
was answered with other than a certain sullen and
unwilling deference, for, in spite of his authoritative
and even autocratic way, something there was
about him that compelled respect. A Socialistic
orator of my acquaintance once spoke of him&mdash;not
to his face&mdash;as one whose politics were pig-headed
and his loyalty pig-iron. I am not altogether sure
what constitutes pig-iron, but if the Socialist meant
that Stone’s loyalty was rigid and unbending I do
not know that I should quarrel with the description.
It was in his loyalty to the throne that all his
intolerance came out. Even those who were at
heart no less loyal than he laughed sometimes at
the boyishness and the extravagance of his worship
for the Queen. The Queen, since she reigned by
divine right, could do no wrong, and had Stone
lived in Stuart times he would have died upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
scaffold, or fallen upon the field, for his Sovereign’s
sake; nor am I sure that even for a Richard the
Third or a King John, had either been his Sovereign,
he would not equally have drawn the sword.</p>

<p>In religious as in other matters, all Stone’s sympathies
were with those who have an affirmation to
make, as contrasted with those who have an objection
to lodge. He detested iconoclasts, and was
prejudiced beforehand against any belief that he
classed with “negatives” as opposed to “positives.”
Just as he disliked the name of Protestant, because
he could not understand a Christian man electing to
be known by a name which “protests” against
another’s faith, instead of affirming his own, so he
found it hard to understand a Church which by its
name proclaimed itself as not being in “conformity”
with or as “dissenting” from another Church.</p>

<p>Stone could not understand that anyone should
prefer the Free Church to the Anglican Catholic
Church, but since it was so (and that it was so he
sincerely and deeply grieved) he felt it better, while
friendly and cordial to all the Nonconformists with
whom he was brought into contact, that each should
go his own way and worship God in his own manner.
Hence he was not of the school of Churchmen who
busy themselves in bringing about a closer union
between Anglicanism and the Free Churches, and
are for the removal of landmarks and the interchange
of pulpits.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he attacked the religion of no
one who believed in the Fatherhood of God, the
Divinity, Atonement, and Resurrection of our Lord,
but reserved all his fighting power for what (a true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Browning lover) he would have accounted “the
arch fiend in visible form”&mdash;the enemies of God
and His Christ. He had no sympathy whatever
with Churchmen who occupy themselves in bickerings
and controversies with Nonconformists, or in
denouncing the Church of Rome. To him good
Churchmanship&mdash;and never was there stronger
Churchman than he&mdash;meant, not disapproval of,
dislike to, or antagonism towards other Churches,
be they Roman or Free, but active love, practical
loyalty and devotion to his own beloved Mother
Church. Hence he never proselytised. He never
sought to turn a Nonconformist into a Churchman,
or a Roman into an English Catholic, but he would
have fought to the last to keep a member of the
Church of England from forsaking that Communion
for any other.</p>

<p>But there was no indefiniteness about his attitude
to Rome. Writing to me in 1899 about some one he
and I knew, who had gone over to Rome, he said:</p>

<p>“I am deeply sorry. Rome is a real branch of the
Church of the Redemption, and has the creeds, the
ministry, and the Sacraments. But to leave our
august Mother for Rome! I do not mean to imply
that to be a Roman, or to become a Roman, has
necessarily anything to do with vital error. I speak
strongly only on the point of <em>comparison</em>, and as a
loyal, happy, and satisfied Catholic of the English
branch. Certain defects I own to in our English
Mother, but they are very small and few, as regards
the accretions and superfluities, to say the least of
them (of which the gravest is Mariolatry), of her
Roman Sister. On the other hand they <em>are</em> sisters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
He loved the name of “Catholic,” and resented
the somewhat arrogant claim to a monopoly in that
beautiful word by the Church of Rome, and if one
of his own congregation used it in this restricted
sense, he never failed, gently but firmly, to make
the correction “Roman Catholic.” His own
Churchmanship he would probably have described
as that of an Anglican Catholic to which, while
agreeing, I may add that he was, at one and the
same time, of the Sacerdotal and of the Evangelical
Schools.</p>

<p>Stone’s sacerdotalism, paradoxical as it may seem
to say so, was not of a “priestly” order, and
“priest” was perhaps the last word which anyone
who did not know him to be a clergyman would
have used of him, or by which his personality would
by a stranger have been described. A Sacerdotalist
he undoubtedly was in the sense of holding firmly
by apostolical succession; but to me he seemed a
Sacerdotalist chiefly in the taking of his sacred
office sacredly. Nor to this day, and for all his
sacerdotalism, am I sure which of the two he placed
the higher&mdash;the priesthood or the people. None
could have held more firmly than he that a priest is
consecrated of God. None could have been more
entirely convinced that the priesthood is consecrated
by, and exists only by, and for, the people. He was,
if anything, more of a congregationalist&mdash;using the
word apart from its purely denominational meaning&mdash;than
are the majority of ministers of that denomination
themselves. The congregational character
of the service at his church was, next to reverence,
the outstanding feature. The congregation were as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
much in evidence throughout as the clergy. They
repeated aloud every prayer for which there was
precedent, or authority for so doing, instead of the
prayer being offered, as in most churches, only by
one of the clergy.</p>

<p>So, too, with the musical service. There was no
anthem, and so far from the burden of the singing
resting upon the choir, Stone often announced a
hymn thus: “The congregation alone singing all
except the first and last verses.” More “hearty”
congregational singing than at his church I have
never heard outside the Metropolitan Tabernacle
(unlovely name for a Christian Church!) when under
that great preacher and true minister of God,
Charles Haddon Spurgeon, five thousand voices
unaccompanied by organ or any other musical instrument
joined in singing the Old Hundredth.
High Churchman as doctrinally Stone was, he was
not a Ritualist. Incense and vestments were never
used in any church of his, and though his people
turned naturally to him for help and advice in
trouble, “Confessions,” in the accepted sense of
the word, were unknown. He was never in conflict
with his Bishop, or the other ecclesiastical authorities,
if only for the reason that his loyalty and his
fine sense of discipline made him constitutionally
incapable of breaking the law. He knelt reverently
in prayer before and after Consecration, and at
other times, but genuflexions and ceremonious and
constant bowing to the altar on the part of the
celebrant, his assistants and the choir, were absent
from the service for which he was responsible.</p>

<p>On one slight but significant act of reverential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
ritual he, however, laid stress. Whenever, in church
or out of church, Stone spoke or heard spoken the
name of our Lord, he never failed, no matter where
or with whom he was, reverently, even if unnoticeably,
slightly to bow his head. “God the Father
and God the Holy Ghost,” I once heard him
say, “no man has ever seen. But God, the Son,
for our sakes, stooped to become Man, and to be
seen of men. For that reason, a reason surely which
should make us more, not less loving and adoring,
some have doubted or denied His Godhead. Hence
when I hear that Holy Name, I incline my head in
adoring worship, as a protest if you like against the
base ingratitude which&mdash;because for our sakes He
stooped to become Man&mdash;would deny that He is
more than man, and in acknowledgment of Him as
my Redeemer, my Lord and my God.” He was indeed
so entirely a poet that no word or name, which
stood for that which he revered, was ever by him
lightly uttered or used. Between his mother and
himself&mdash;his father died either just before, or soon
after, I came to know the son, and I never saw the
two together, though I know that their relationship
was ideal&mdash;existed the most beautiful love and
devotion, and if only for her sake, the very word
“mother” was consecrate upon his lips. Four
times only is the halo seen around the head of
mortal. Around the head of a little soul newly
come from God, there is seen the rainbow-hued halo
of childhood; around the head of lad or maiden,
man or woman, who, in love’s supreme and sacred
season, is lifted nearest to God, there radiates the
rose-coloured halo of love; around the head of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
who have newly gone to God, glows the purple-royal
halo of death; and around the head of a young
mother, fondling her first-born, shines out the white
and sacred halo of motherhood.</p>

<p>To Stone the halo of motherhood was visible, even
around the head of those whom this world counts
and calls “fallen.” Motherhood was to him, in itself,
and apart from the attendant circumstances,
so sacred and beautiful, that the very word
“mother,” as he spoke it, seemed surrounded by the
halo of his reverence. The widowed Queen whom
he knew and loved, and by whom he was held in
regard and esteem, was to him no less our Mother&mdash;the
type and symbol of English Motherhood&mdash;than
she was our Sovereign. Of the august and ancient
Catholic Church of which he was so loyal a son he
rarely used the simile “The Bride of Christ,” which
one frequently hears in sermons, but spoke of her,
and with eyes aglow, as the Mother of her people;
and it was of England, our Mother, that he sang
with passionate love in many of his poems. So, too,
the words “Holy Communion” assumed, as he
spoke them, a meaning that was sacramental. The
reverent lowering of his voice was like the dipping
of a battleship’s ensign.</p>

<p>Again, in that portion of the service, in which,
preceding the reading of the Ten Commandments, the
Celebrant says, “God spake these words, and said,”
many clergymen lay no stress on any particular
word, but speak or intone all six in one more or less
monotonous voice. It was not so with Stone. He
spoke the passage thus:</p>

<p>“God&mdash;&mdash;” the Holy Name was uttered with intense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
reverence and solemnity, which recalled to the
congregation how awful is the Source whence these
ancient Commandments come. Then there was a
pause that every hearer might attune his or her
thought to reverent attention, and the Celebrant
would continue&mdash;“spake these words, and said,”
passing on thence to the First Commandment.</p>

<p>And, lastly, I would say that I never heard
human voice thrill with such devotion, such worshipping
and wondering adoration, as that with
which he spoke the name of our Saviour. That
Name, the Holy and adored Name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, was so
linked with all that he held sacred that he never
uttered it without pausing before and after the Holy
Name, that no less hallowed a word should be neighbour
to that Name on his lips.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Upon one incident in my long friendship with
Stone I look back with pain and sorrow. He came
in late one night, just as the last post had brought
me the news&mdash;I would not write of such things here
except in so far as it bears upon my friend&mdash;that the
whole edition of my first little book had been sold
out.</p>

<p>To-day the writing of a book, if only because it
may be the means of bringing influence to bear upon
others, is, I am of opinion, an occupation to be followed
diligently, conscientiously, and with pleasurable
zest. None the less, as compared with what some
men are doing in the way of direct personal service
to God, to their King, their country and their fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
creatures, it seems to me an occupation too inactive
to afford cause for congratulation that one is thus
employed. But in those days I desired nothing more
than to be a successful author, little imagining that
success in authorship does not necessarily mean the
making either of literature or of a man.</p>

<p>When Stone came in that night, so full was I of
the great news, as I held it to be, about my book,
that I must needs rush at him, as volubly and importantly
to pour it all out, as if the fate of empires
hung upon the issue. He had a genius for friendship,
and heard me out patiently and gently to the
end, to say: “I am so glad, so very glad, dear
fellow, and congratulate you with all my heart,”
or words to that effect. Then he broached the subject
of his call, a matter of infinitely more importance
than any news of mine. It did not concern
himself, or I should, I hope, have acted differently,
but a member of his congregation, unknown to me,
whom Stone was trying to assist in a time of trouble
and anxiety. So far as I remember I hastily promised
the assistance for which he asked, but, when he
essayed to speak further of the matter, I interrupted
him rudely, once again and boastfully to speak of
my book.</p>

<p>Stone so habitually suppressed it, that few suspected
how great was his gift of satire. When he
chose, or rather had he so chosen, he could so wing
his satiric shaft as to pierce the thickest hide, and
never was he more tempted to employ this “devil’s
weapon” as he held it to be, than when irritated
by vulgar boastfulness.</p>

<p>Looking back long years after upon this incident,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
I know that to no one could what happened that
night be more irritating, and even objectionable,
than to Stone. On the part of a friend, it was an
affront to everything by which he held in our
social code, a wound to his own pride of breeding
and good manners. How sorely I must have
tempted and irritated him, I now fully realise, yet
his affection for the offender held back the stinging
word, and neither then, nor at any other time in our
long friendship, did I ever hear from him one reproachful
or ungentle word. I recall his forbearance
to me&mdash;a very young man when he was becoming
middle-aged, and so might reasonably have spoken&mdash;on
this particular occasion, an occasion which
even now I cannot recall without shame. I recall
a score of times when I grieved him by my apathy
upon some question upon which he felt intensely,
for Stone’s convictions were so positively held that
he would readily have gone to the stake in defence
of them, and that those he loved, and to whom he
looked for sympathy, could be apathetic upon
matters which he held to be of vital consequence,
was to him a positive pain. I recall all these, and
many other things in which I failed or wounded him
by some indifference, some thoughtless act, or unconsidered
word, and remembering that never once
did he fail me by sympathy, interest, help or love
withheld&mdash;I sicken at my own unworthiness, and at
the thought of the sorry return I made for all his
love and forbearance.</p>

<p>It is with relief that I turn to another incident in
the early days of our friendship.</p>

<p>One night, in the eighties, when I was dining with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Stone and his and my kind old friend, the Rev.
Frederick Arnold, at St. Paul’s Vicarage, Haggerston,
a maid brought in the last post. Stone asked
permission to run through his letters, in case there
was anything requiring an immediate answer. Over
one he uttered an exclamation of glad and grateful
surprise.</p>

<p>“Good news?” one of us asked.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Stone, flushed and radiant.
He hesitated a moment. Then, handing Mr. Arnold
the letter, he said, “There is no reason why you
two, one an old, and the other a young, but both
true and dear friends of mine, should not see it.”</p>

<p>It was from the Bishop of London&mdash;I think Bishop
Jackson, but of this I am not quite sure. In any
case it was a very gracious letter. Upon Stone, the
Bishop said, the mantle of John Keble had by virtue
of his hymns, admittedly fallen. Thus far Stone had
for some fifteen years given all his time, energies,
and abilities to working among poor and uneducated
folk in an East End parish, where practically
the whole of the small stipend was swallowed
up in church work and charities, and where Stone
had no time or opportunity to do justice to his gifts
as a writer. The Bishop was aware, he said, that
Stone was fast wearing himself out, and could not
go on much longer. Hence he had pleasure in putting
before Stone the offer of preferment to a West
End parish, where he would have an educated, intellectual,
and appreciative congregation, as well
as the leisure and the opportunity to devote his
great gifts as poet and hymn-writer for the benefit
of the church and the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
It was a tempting offer, for much as Stone loved
sport and travel he had hitherto had neither the
time nor the money for anything more extended
than a few weeks in Switzerland or in “God’s Infirmary”
(as quoting George MacDonald he often
called the country), generally on a visit to his old
friend the Rev. Donald Carr, of Woolstaston Rectory,
Salop. Moreover, though Stone grudged no service
given to God or to his own congregation, he grieved
sometimes that he had so little time to devote to
hymn-writing and to literature, concerning which
he had many projects. In a letter dated June 15,
1892, he had written to me, “I am up to my ears
in work and behindhand because, if you please, I
am in the thick of writing a religious novel. I am
not really joking!”</p>

<p>But grateful as he was for the Bishop’s kind and
fatherly offer, Stone declined it as, later on, he
declined similar offers, including a Colonial Bishopric.</p>

<p>“I am not and I do not expect to be the man
I was,” he said to Mr. Arnold and me that night,
“but I ought to be, and am, thankful that, nervously
constituted as I am, I have gone through fifteen
years in the East End, out of twenty-three in the
Ministry. When health and strength give out, when
for my people’s sake I must let the work pass into
younger and stronger hands, I will go. Till then, in
Haggerston, where my heart is, and where the people
whom I love are living, I must remain.”</p>

<p>And in Haggerston he remained working early in
the morning and late in the night until 1890, when
the collapse, alike of nerve and physical strength,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
came, and he had to resign&mdash;to be appointed by the
Lord Chancellor to the comparatively easy living of
All Hallows, London Wall.</p>

<p>But Stone was not the man to spare himself in his
new sphere of labour. What the wrench of parting
and the strain necessitated by sweeping aside the
cobwebs, and by trying to warm into life the dry
bones, as he put it, of a long-neglected City church
cost him, may be gathered from the one and only
sad letter I ever had from him. It is written from
the house of his sister, Mrs. Boyd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2"><span class="smcap">Woodside Lodge</span>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">South Norwood Hill, S.E.</span>,<br />
<span class="l2"><i>Nov. 28, 1891</i>.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Kernahan</span>,</p>

<p class="let">I have, in a very busy life, never passed
through such a time of depression as in the last nine
or ten months. In the Spring I left the old Parish
of 21 years’ work and 31 years’ memories&mdash;and how
I got through the next couple of months I scarcely
know. Only by Grace of God. I went to Southend
for a fortnight, but it was simply a <em>ghastly</em> time, I
was ill in body and mind. Except for the faith
which Tennyson describes in the case of Enoch
Arden’s coming home, through which a man (believing
in the Incarnation, and therefore in the
Perfect Human Sympathy of God) cannot be “all
unhappy,” I don’t know what would have become
of me. I left behind me, you know how much&mdash;how
many is represented by 537 communicants,
nearly all of them my spiritual children, and I had
before me, not a “howling wilderness” but a silent
wilderness of the worst of the City churches. A
howling wilderness would have stirred up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
soldier’s blood that is in me&mdash;but the desolation
which I felt so ill was like a winding sheet. You
must come and see me at All Hallows, and while I
show you the beautiful present, I will show you in
actual fact some of the dry bones.</p>

<p>I need not tell you that I have had a great deal to
do Haggerstonwards. And oh! my correspondence
with my old children!</p>

<p>I hope this does not sound to you like complaint
or self-pity. I only mean it as explanation&mdash;which
would not be given in these terms, except to one
very much (I know) of my own temperament. Indeed,
there is no cause for anything but thankfulness.
My nerves were too worn out for Haggerston
any longer. My successor is one almost entirely
after my own heart&mdash;my new parish is exactly one
(nearest to Haggerston in the City) I wished for.
The task of renovation, though it makes me a poor
man for a year or two, has been very good by way
of distraction and for the delight of making a
garden out of such a wilderness of dry bones, and
after another six or nine months I may be able to
afford a curate, and, having no further special
financial or parochial anxieties, be able to settle to
some final literary work. Indeed, I am as I ought to
be, very thankful.</p>

<p>So far most egotistically.</p>

<p>I am interested with my whole heart in what you
tell me of yourself. Do come and see me, to tell
more. I will promise to send you what I write, if
you will undertake to do the same.</p>

<p>God bless you, dear friend.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1">Ever your most affectionate,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">S. J. Stone</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
The depression passed, and Stone recovered
sufficiently to throw himself, heart and soul, and for
some years, into his now memorable work among
the “hands” employed in City warehouses, shops
and factories. Once again it was for the poor, or for
the comparatively poor that he toiled, and once
again he spared himself in nothing. His letters (I
have enough almost for a book) tell of the joy and
contentment he found in the work, and of his thankfulness
to God for what had been done.</p>

<p>But he had made the change from the heavier
work at Haggerston too late, and even in the easier
charge, which, in order that he might husband his
failing strength and outworn energies had been
found for him, he would not, or could not spare himself&mdash;with
the result that, in the autumn of 1899,
he had another breakdown. Meeting him unexpectedly
one day on the Embankment, after not
seeing him for some little time, I was inexpressibly
shocked at the change. He told me that he had
been feeling very ill for some weeks, and was then
on his way to meet the friend who was accompanying
him to see a specialist, and that I should, without
delay, know the result of the examination which
was to be made. Not many hours had passed before
I had a letter. The malady, Stone said, was cancer,
it was feared in a malignant form, and there must
be an operation, and soon.</p>

<p>With all the old and infinite thought and tenderness
for others, he gave me gently to understand
that the case was not too hopeful&mdash;he was terribly
run down, his heart was weak: he had overstrained
it while at Oxford&mdash;and even should he survive the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
operation, there was small likelihood of recovery.
Here is the conclusion of his letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Keep a quiet mind about me, dear friend. I have
not so learned Christ that I make any real difference
between life and death, but remember me before
God.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Ever yours most affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">S. J. Stone</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Scarcely a day of the months which followed was
free from pain. Yet he wrote, “I live in a kind of
thankful wonder that I should be so encompassed
by the goodness of God and the lovingkindness of
men.” To the end he retained all his old interests.
He continued, in the brief respites from terrible
bouts of pain, to attend the church of All Hallows,
of which he was still rector, and to minister to his
people, and even to follow, with intense patriotic
interest, every event in the South African War.</p>

<p>The day preceding his death, Sunday, he was at
All Hallows; and the very day of his passing he
wrote, “I am in such pain that I can neither write
nor dictate. At others I am just able to write ‘with
mine own hand.’ But whether at the worst or at the
best in a <em>bodily</em> state, spiritually I am not only in
patience, but in joy of heart and soul.” Soon after
came a brief space of unconsciousness and&mdash;the end.</p>

<p>So died one who was liker Christ than any other
man or woman I have known. His love for his
fellows was so passionate and so unselfish that, could
he have taken upon himself, to save them from sin,
sorrow, and suffering, a similar burden to that which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
his Lord and Master bore, he would not have hesitated&mdash;he
would gladly have hastened&mdash;to make
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The mistakes he made were many, though I remember
none that was not made from high motive,
generous impulse, misplaced zeal, or childlike
singleness of purpose, which to the last led him to
credit others with truth, loyalty, honour, and sincerity,
like to his own. In the beautiful hymn
which he so loved, and with which he so often ended
evensong, we read:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For none are wholly free from sin,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">but if sin there was in Stone, as in all that is human,
I can truly say that, in our twenty-five years’ intimate
friendship, I saw in him no sign of anything
approaching sin, other than&mdash;if sins they be&mdash;a
noble anger and a lofty pride. To have loved, and
to have been loved and trusted by him, was no less
a high privilege than it was a high responsibility,
for if any of us, who at some time of our lives, shared
Stone’s interests and ideals, and were brought under
the compelling power and inspiration of his personality,
should hereafter come to forget what
manner of man he was&mdash;should play false with, or
altogether fall away, from those ideals, or be content
to strive after any less noble standard of conduct
and character than he set and attained&mdash;then heavy
indeed must be our reckoning, in the day when for
these, to whom much has been given, much will be
required.</p>

<p>For Stone had something of the talismanic personality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
of his Master. Just as, without one spoken
word&mdash;without more than a look&mdash;from the Christ
the unclean were convicted of sin by the talisman
of His purity, so all that was noblest, divinest and
knightliest in man, all that was white-souled, selfless,
tender, true, lofty, and lovely in womanhood,
recognised something of itself in Stone, and in his
presence all were at their highest and their best.</p>

<p>Nor was this due merely to what has been called
a “magnetic personality.” That there are men and
women who for good or for evil (it is just as likely
to be for the latter as for the former) possess some
magnetic or mesmeric power over others, I am, and
from personal knowledge, aware. But Stone’s influence
was neither mesmeric nor magnetic. It was
by the unconscious spiritual alchemy of a soul so
rare (I repeat and purposely near the end of this
article what I said in the beginning) as to make
possible the courage of a Cœur de Lion, the honour
of a King Arthur or Sir Galahad&mdash;as to make possible
even in a sense the sinlessness of Christ. To have
known, if only once in a lifetime&mdash;and in spite of
bitter disillusionments, of repeated betrayals on the
part of some others&mdash;such a man as S.&nbsp;J. Stone, is
in itself enough to keep sweet one’s faith in humanity,
in immortality, and in God.</p>

<p>Some time before Stone’s death I had been much
thrown into the company of a gifted and brilliant
thinker and man of Science, who had very little belief&mdash;I
will not say in the existence of a God, but at
least in the existence of a God who takes thought
for the welfare of mortals, and no belief whatever
in existence after death. In our walks and conversations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
he had adduced many arguments in
support of annihilation, which it was difficult to
answer; and I remember that, when on the morning
that Stone died, I stooped to press my lips to the
forehead of the friend I loved and revered as I have
loved and revered none other since nor shall again,
it seemed for a moment as if the man of whom I
have spoken as disbelieving in personal immortality,
were, in spirit, at my elbow and whispering in my
ear. “Look well upon your friend’s face!” the
Voice seemed to say, “and you shall see written
there: ‘Nobly done, bravely done, greatly done, if
you will,’ but you shall also see written there, ‘<em>Done
and ended! done and ended&mdash;and for evermore!</em>’”
I remember, too, that it seemed as if some evil
power, outside myself, were trying, by means of
what hypnotists call “suggestion,” to compel me
to see, upon the dead face, what that evil power
wished me to see there.</p>

<p>For one moment, after the whispering of the words
“Done and ended! done and ended&mdash;and for evermore,”
I thought I saw something in the dead face
that seemed dumbly to acquiesce in, and to endorse
the tempter’s words, until another and very different
voice (I have wondered sometimes whether it were
not my friend’s) whispered to me, “If the friend
whom you loved be indeed annihilated and has
ceased to be&mdash;then the Eternal and Omnipotent
God whom he, a man and a mortal, ever remembered
<em>has forgotten him, for annihilation means no more and
no less than utterly to be forgotten of God</em>. If that be
so, if God can forget, if He can forget those who
never forgot Him, then is that God less loving, less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
faithful, and less remembering than the mortal
whom He has made. Can you, dare you, think this
awful and unthinkable thing of the Living and
Loving God in whom your friend so wholly
trusted?”</p>

<p>And, looking upon the face of my friend, I saw
written there, not only the august dignity, the lone
and awful majesty of death, but also the rapture,
the peace, the serenity, the triumph of one who
staggers spent and bleeding but victorious from the
battle, to hear himself acclaimed God’s soldier and
Christ’s knight, and to kneel in wondering awe, in
worshipping ecstasy, at the feet of his Saviour and
his God.</p>

<p>And remembering what I saw written on the dead
face of my friend, remembering the life he led and
the God in whom he trusted, I have no fear that my
own faith will fail me again in life or in death.</p>

<p><em>And we also bless thy holy Name for all thy servants
departed this life in thy faith and fear; beseeching
thee to give us grace so to follow their good examples,
that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly
kingdom. Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ’s
sake, our only Mediator and Advocate.</em> Amen.</p>

<h2>SOME OPINIONS OF MR. KERNAHAN’S PUBLISHED WORK</h2>
</div>

<p><cite>Saturday Review.</cite>&mdash;“There is a touch of genius, perhaps even
more than a touch, about this brilliant and original booklet.”</p>

<p><cite>Times.</cite>&mdash;“A writer of much insight and originality.”</p>

<p><cite>Spectator.</cite>&mdash;“Truly as well as finely said.”</p>

<p><cite>Contemporary Review.</cite>&mdash;“A brilliantly versatile novelist and
a charming essayist.”</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">J. M. Barrie</span>, in the <cite>British Weekly</cite>.&mdash;“The vigour of
this book is great, and the author has an uncommon gift of
intensity. On many readers, it may be guessed, the book will
have a mesmeric effect.”</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">A. Quiller-Couch</span>.&mdash;“It is, as is every story which Mr.
Kernahan writes, vivid, and effectively told.”</p>

<p><cite>Daily Chronicle.</cite>&mdash;“Of haunting beauty.”</p>

<p><cite>Academy.</cite>&mdash;“His book is a fine one, and we think it will live.”</p>

<p><cite>Bookman.</cite>&mdash;“Work which deserves to live.”</p>

<p><cite>Punch.</cite>&mdash;“Rises are freely predicted in Kernahans.” (Mr.
Punch on “The Literary Stock Exchange.”)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">I. Zangwill</span>.&mdash;“A genius for poetical and spiritual
allegory.”</p>

<p><cite>Truth.</cite>&mdash;“No one approaches Mr. Kernahan in the sincerity
and intensity of his imaginative flights. For myself I can say
that I have read <cite>Visions</cite> with the keenest pleasure. They
have the penetrating and the revealing power of Ithuriel’s
spear.... Extraordinarily powerful.”</p>

<p><cite>Morning Post.</cite>&mdash;“The prose is fascinating, the matter is
important to every thinking man, the treatment is so attractive
that one is compelled to read the book from cover to cover at
once. Studies in which the imagination takes strong wings,
written in prose that is both masculine in quality and haunting.”</p>

<p><cite>Globe.</cite>&mdash;“A brilliant success.”</p>

<p><cite>Daily Telegraph.</cite>&mdash;“Great reverence and much literary
power.”</p>

<p><cite>Athenæum.</cite>&mdash;“Of singular beauty and tenderness, but at the
same time full of critical insight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
<cite>St. James’s Gazette.</cite>&mdash;“It would seem as if the author of <cite>A
Dead Man’s Diary</cite> and <cite>A Book of Strange Sins</cite> had found
for the weird moods and impulses, the sighs and sobs from a hidden
world, which he has before controlled in the realm of fiction,
a local habitation and a name in the personalities of the actual
mortals he delineates in these luminous sketches.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eden Phillpotts</span>.&mdash;“These scholarly papers. His essay
on Heine shows a wonderfully accurate estimate of that fantastic
genius, while his <cite>Rossetti</cite> shows critical insight of a high order.”</p>

<p><cite>Pall Mall Gazette.</cite>&mdash;“If one of the wholesome offices of tragic
literature be to purify the soul by terror, Mr. Kernahan has done
something towards the purification of the world.”</p>

<p><cite>Daily Mail.</cite>&mdash;“Crowded with pictures of great imaginative
beauty.... There can be no doubt that this little book must
make a very deep and abiding impression upon the hearts and
minds of all who read it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">T. P. O’Connor</span>.&mdash;“I do not remember to have read for
a long time a study of the deadliness to soul and body&mdash;of what
I may even call the murderousness of purely sensual passion&mdash;in
which the moral is so finely, and I must use the word, awfully
conveyed.”</p>

<p><cite>Evening News.</cite>&mdash;“The revelations are those of a man of
genius. Callous or brainless must the man or woman be who
can rise from its perusal without tumultuous and chastening
thought.”</p>

<p><cite>The Daily Chronicle.</cite>&mdash;“A writer possessing not only a fine
literary gift, and a marvellous power of intense emotional
realisation, but a fresh, strange, and fascinating imaginative
outlook. We know of nothing published in recent years which,
in lurid impressiveness and relentless veracity of rendering, is to
be compared with this.”</p>

<p><cite>The Sketch.</cite>&mdash;“The daring freshness of his thought, his great
ability in expressing it, his contempt for common tradition, the
sincerity which exudes from every page of his work, captivate
the reader. I do not know any piece of prose which opens up so
many great questions in so few lines.”</p>

<p><cite>The Star.</cite>&mdash;“Palpitating with life. Terrible in their intensity
and vivid vivisection of human mind and character. In dealing
with such subjects as these, any one but Mr. Kernahan would be
morbid, perhaps revolting. Mr. Kernahan writes of them with
a power which is often genius. The work of a man who, seeing
beneath the crust of life, had the courage and the power to write
what he saw.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barry Pain</span>.&mdash;“We find beautiful and appreciative
writing in these pages.”</p>

<p><cite>The Illustrated London News.</cite>&mdash;“All must recognise the boundless
charity, the literary power, and the intense sincerity of one
of the most interesting works of the year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
The late Mr. <span class="smcap">B. Fletcher Robinson</span>, in <cite>Daily Express</cite>.&mdash;“There
are two Coulson Kernahans. The one is a novelist who
loves a good plot, and a dashing adventure; the other a serious
thinker who rises to imaginative heights in his efforts to pierce
the mystery that cloaks the future life of us poor mortals.”</p>

<p><cite>The Times.</cite>&mdash;“He is perhaps the hundredth individual who
in recent fiction has devoted himself to amateur detection, and
he is certainly ‘one in a hundred’ as regards his exceptional
success.... This simple sample must suffice for extract, but
we may assure the reader that there are plenty more where it
came from.”</p>

<p><cite>World.</cite>&mdash;“A writer of fiction who has come among us carrying
Aladdin’s lamp&mdash;imagination.... Bold and brilliant in
inception.... Deep and tender humanity pervades the whole
work.”</p>

<p><cite>Literary World.</cite>&mdash;“A man with a command of beautiful
English with exquisite insight into the poetry of life and with
the delicate touch of the rare literary critic.... A volume of
delightful essays, almost Lamblike in their tender pathos and
humour.”</p>

<p><cite>New York World</cite> (U.S.A.).&mdash;“The strongest stories that have
been written in many a long day. No one who is guilty of sin
can read these stories without realising their truth. They are
like Conscience sitting alone with him staring him steadily
sternly in the face.... This spiritual rhapsody shows you one
facet of this brilliant Irishman’s genius. Turn to the <cite>Literary
Gent</cite>, and you will see another utterly different&mdash;fearful, almost
cruel.”</p>

<p><cite>Boston Herald</cite> (U.S.A.)&mdash;“A book which must certainly be
accounted one of the pronounced literary successes of the time.
It has gone through various editions in America, as well as in
England, and I think no one who has read it could ever quite
escape from its haunting spell. It contains passages of poetic
prose, which no lover of the beautiful will overlook, and its
appeal to the consciences of men is even more strenuous. I am
not surprised to hear that the first English edition of 2000 copies
was exhausted a few days after publication.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise Chandler Moulton</span> (U.S.A.) in Syndicate Article,
“Four Modern Men.”&mdash;“A story which Hawthorne might have
been content to sign.... Two prose-poems which to my mind
far surpass the prose-poems of Turgenieff.... This has been
compared to Mrs. Gatty’s <cite>Parables from Nature</cite>, but Mrs.
Gatty has never written anything to rank with it for poetic
charm. To find this exquisite and tender idyl among these
tragedies of shipwrecked souls is like hearing the divine note of
the nightingale through the stress and clamour of a tempest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
[In collaboration with the late Mr. Frederick Locker-Lampson.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmund Gosse</span>, C.B., in the <cite>Illustrated London News</cite>.&mdash;“Where
so many skilful hands have tried to produce rival
anthologies, these two, each in its own class, preserve their unquestionable
superiority. Mr. Locker-Lampson has been helped
in re-publication by Mr. Coulson Kernahan, who has entered
into the elegant spirit of the Editor, and has continued his
labours with taste and judgment.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">A. C. Swinburne</span>, in his volume, <cite>Studies in Prose and
Poetry</cite>.&mdash;“There is no better or completer anthology in the
language. I doubt, indeed, if there be any so good or so complete.
No objection or suggestion which can reasonably be
offered can in any way diminish our obligation, either to the
original Editor, or to his evidently able assistant, Mr. Coulson
Kernahan.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p><cite>Times.</cite>&mdash;“All that has happened, all that has been said or thought
about the war, is preserved by Mr. Pepys, Junior, in a style that robs
it of all offence and gives us a faithful mirror of our times.”</p>

<p><cite>Scotsman.</cite>&mdash;“The trick of intermingling small things with great and
of slipping without effort, in the immortal Samuel’s best style, from the
great European conflict to his wife’s hats is so reminiscent that the
pages move the reader to constant smiles.”</p>

<p><cite>Pall Mall Gazette.</cite>&mdash;“It is hard to decide which is more pleasing in
this book&mdash;the text or the illustrations. The Senior Pepys has transmitted
something of all his wonderful and divers qualities to the
descendant&mdash;his ubiquitous eye, his garrulousness, his exuberant egoism
and perfect selfishness, and his humour.”</p>

<p><cite>Star.</cite>&mdash;“A more agreeable gallery of diverting worldlings we have
seldom met.”</p>

<p><cite>Westminster Gazette.</cite>&mdash;“Being absolutely inimitable, Pepys has had
many imitators. But none with whom we are acquainted has succeeded
so well in a most difficult task as ‘Samuel Pepys, Junr.’”</p>

<p><cite>Land and Water.</cite>&mdash;“Great events have crowded so quickly on one
another that already we find it difficult to arrange our recollections
rightly. In this diary, flavoured with Attic salt, we are carried back to
hours and controversies which seem to-day almost to belong to a
previous life. Into whatever page one may choose to dip, there is
something to arrest attention, to encourage reading and to awaken
mirth.”</p>

<p><cite>To-Day.</cite>&mdash;“Here at length we have an imitation of Pepys’ Diary
which is as perfect and satisfying as such a thing could well be. Samuel
Pepys, Junior, knows the original with uncanny exactitude.”</p>

<p><cite>British Weekly.</cite>&mdash;“A book of genius. In many ways it is the most
wonderful book that this war has produced.”</p>

<p><cite>Daily Mail.</cite>&mdash;“It is the most diverting book that has appeared for
many a day. Laughable though the book is, it has the seriousness and
the acid of all good satire, and is as faithful a history withal of these
days as any that the serious historians have penned.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who have read “Under the Tricolour” will recognise
Barnavaux at an old friend, as he is the “hero” of many of the stories
in both works. All the stories are entirely original, and they are
striking in different ways, many of them being worthy of comparison
with the works of the greatest French short-story writers.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
